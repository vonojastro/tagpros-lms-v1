            Tagpros classes should be objective, secular, and age-appropriate. &nbsp;We
            have adopted this policy so that Tagpros classes can be relevant and inclusive
            to the widest audience, and so parents can participate in any Tagpros class
            knowing they will not be subjected to a teacher's personal, religious, or
            political beliefs, as well as other objectionable content. We limit classes in
            certain sensitive areas that are detailed further below.

            Of course, many classes need to address religion - for example, you can't
            teach history without talking about religion. &nbsp;It's critical to teach
            about religion, but to not promote or advocate a particular religious
            worldview.

            In the course of class discussion, students may raise questions about a

            influence students.

        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            We do not support classes that provide medical training or medical services.
            &nbsp;This includes, but is not limited to, first aid, CPR, therapy,
            counseling, psychiatric evaluations, or evaluations for special education
            services. &nbsp;We do not offer these classes on Tagpros out of concern for
            learners&rsquo; safety and well-being. &nbsp;We recognize that many classes
            can touch on these subjects, so we have provided some clarifying examples
            below:
          </span>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li aria-level='1'>
            <span>
              Classes offering workouts or exercise routines are allowed, but classes
              offering physical therapy are considered medical services.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li aria-level='1'>
            <span>
              Classes teaching general information about nutrition or a type of diet (eg.
              What is veganism?) are allowed, but classes with targeted nutrition advice
              to learners are considered medical services and require more expertise. They
              may not be appropriate for the Tagpros platform. All class subject matter
              must be science/fact based, and not promote any single perspective on
              nutrition and diet. For example, teaching what Vitamin D does for your body
              would be okay for someone with a basic understanding, but teaching{' '}
            </span>
            <i>

            </i>
            <span>
              to get enough Vitamin D requires additional expertise. Any class promoting
              weight loss is not allowed on Tagpros.

          <li aria-level='1'>
            <span>
              Classes offering information about mental health or non-medical symptom
              management strategies are allowed, but classes offering individual or group
              therapy targeted towards learners with diagnosed medical conditions, trauma,
              or grief are considered a medical service. &nbsp;For example, classes
              offering techniques to handle day-to-day stress or anxiety are allowed, but
              classes offering therapeutic support specifically for learners suffering
              from chronic anxiety or anxiety disorders would be a medical service.
              &nbsp;Social support groups, such as for military children or learners with
              other shared experience, are not usually considered a medical service but
              will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis as a sensitive/experts only topic.

          <span>
            Classes that present a higher risk for potential safety hazards will be
            evaluated on a case-by-case basis. &nbsp;Examples include, but are not limited
            to, classes on swimming, driving, or wilderness survival techniques. &nbsp;For
            classes that are appropriate for the platform, we will require teachers to
            have a high level of professional training, expertise, or experience working
            with youth in the subject. &nbsp;Additionally, we require teachers to provide
            extensive parental guidance information.

          <Bold>Pseudoscience and supernatural topics</Bold>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            For topics that may be considered pseudoscience or supernatural in nature,
            material should be presented from a scientific and secular perspective.
            Pseudoscience, supernatural, or paranormal topics can include any topics that
            are not agreed upon by a preponderance of experts, explanations for phenomena
            that are not well supported by research, or any topics that have their basis
            in folklore or superstition, but are not supported by the scientific
            community. &nbsp;Example topics can include - but are not limited to -
            essential oil treatments, crystal healing, the law of attraction, ghosts,
            astrology, fortune-telling, or extraterrestrial beings.&nbsp; Topics in these
            categories generally have a basis in history, culture, or speculation.
            &nbsp;As such, they should not be presented as fact, but rather explored from
            a cultural or historical perspective. Descriptions should make clear that the
            approach is based on mainstream science, culture, or history, rather than
            promoting these topics as scientific truth or as part of a supernatural
            worldview. &nbsp;

          <Bold>Marginalized Groups</Bold>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            Marginalized groups of people include groups who have historically been
            overlooked or who have faced discrimination based on factors including, but
            not limited to, sex, gender, age, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual
            orientation, or gender identity. Tagpros believes that classes based on these
            groups and topics deserve equal treatment and, occasionally, special
            consideration. In order to ensure that Tagpros is not spreading false
            narratives nor reinforcing discrimination and prejudice, Tagpros has higher
            expectations and scrutiny for evaluating these classes and the teachers who
            lead them. We would expect to see expertise in areas like education, community
            involvement, life experience, additional training or other things that might
            show expertise based on the marginalized group you are teaching about.&nbsp;
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Expectations for these classes:</span>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li aria-level='1'>
            <span>
              Teachers have a degree connected to the topic they are teaching or
              additional training/education related to the topic.&nbsp;

          <li aria-level='1'>
            <span>
              The sources used in class need to come from widely respected
              scholars/professionals in the field.&nbsp;
            </span>
          </li>
          <li aria-level='1'>
            <span>
              The Class Experience section of the class&rsquo;s description will need to
              contain an explanation of any resources that deal with racism and
              discrimination and include how those will be handled.

        </ol>
        <p>
          <span>
            Tagpros requires that content on Tagpros be objective. &nbsp;Teaching the
            history and experiences of these marginalized groups leads to content being
            more objective: objectivity gives a more complete picture than has been
            traditionally told or studied. &nbsp;To counter the traditional narrative,
            more focus may be given to these groups in some classes and there may be
            classes entirely devoted to these specific groups or their experiences.
            &nbsp;Other perspectives must still be acknowledged so that the full story of
            the issue in question is taught. &nbsp;

          <Bold>Role-Playing&nbsp;</Bold>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            Tagpros understands the value of role-playing in education. &nbsp;Allowing
            students to take various perspectives and make decisions or solve crises helps
            students understand the concepts and learn empathy for those involved.
            &nbsp;Role-playing can include events or situations that are hypothetical or
            historical and any activity from acting out a situation like a play to making
            decisions based on historical text or hypothetical situations. &nbsp;When
            creating class listings that include role-playing, there are certain things
            that Tagpros will look for and that the teacher will need to consider:
          </span>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li aria-level='1'>
            <span>
              Be sure there is time before the lesson to pre-teach any important
              information and lay out the parameters for the role-playing. Consider how
              you will approach any students that do not follow those parameters.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li aria-level='1'>
            <span>
              If students are role-playing various perspectives, they may only really
              learn the one they play. &nbsp;Consider how you can ensure they learn
              numerous different perspectives.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li aria-level='1'>
            <span>
              Ensure that there is ample time set aside after the role-playing to discuss
              any situations that arose that may need extra discussion or clarification,
              come back to the larger context and purpose of the role play, and to tie up
              any loose ends.
            </span>
          </li>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <span>
            Some topics are so sensitive that they fall outside of Tagpros policies if
            they are role-played. &nbsp;Each class listing that includes role-playing will
            be evaluated with higher scrutiny as follows:
