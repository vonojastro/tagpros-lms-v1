          <strong>Access and Use of the Service</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Services Description:</strong>&nbsp;Tagpros&rsquo;&rsquo;s Service is an online marketplace for K-12
          classes, designed for Parents to find and book Classes for the benefit of their child or children, and for
          Teachers to market, sell and conduct their Classes. As the provider of an online marketplace, Tagpros does not
          own, create, sell, resell, control, or manage any Classes. Tagpros's responsibilities are limited to: (i)
          providing the Site as an online marketplace and platform to facilitate the sale, purchase, and conduct of
          Classes, and (ii) serving as the limited agent of each Teacher for the purpose of accepting payments from a
          Parent on behalf of the Teacher. There are risks that you assume when dealing with other Users (including
          those who may be acting under false pretenses). While Tagpros strives to provide a safe and welcoming
          environment (how do we safeguard) for its Users, you agree that all of these risks are ultimately borne by
          you, and not Tagpros. Tagpros does not control the behavior of Users or the quality of the Classes. As a
          result, Tagpros cannot guarantee the authenticity, quality, safety, legality, or appropriateness of the
          Classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Your Registration Obligations:</strong>&nbsp;You will be required to register with Tagpros in order to
          access and use certain features of the Service. If you choose to register for the Service, you agree to
          provide and maintain true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the
          Service&rsquo;s registration form. Registration data and certain other information about you are governed by
          our&nbsp;<a href="https://outschool.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. You must be of legal age to form a
          binding contract to register for the Service (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18). If you are not yet of
          legal age to form a binding contract, then you must get your Parent to read these Terms of Service and agree
          to them for you before you use the Service. If you are a Parent and you provide your consent to your child's
          use of the Service, then you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service with respect to your child&rsquo;s
          use of the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Member Account, Password and Security:</strong>&nbsp;You are responsible for maintaining the
          confidentiality of your password and account, if any, and are fully responsible for any and all activities
          that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Tagpros of any unauthorized use
          of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at
          the end of each session when accessing the Service. Tagpros will not be liable for any loss or damage arising
          from your failure to comply with this Section.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Modifications to Service:</strong>&nbsp;Tagpros reserves the right to modify or discontinue,
          temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that Tagpros
          will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the
          Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>General Practices Regarding Use and Storage:</strong>&nbsp;You acknowledge that Tagpros may establish
          general practices and limits concerning use of the Service, including without limitation the maximum period of
          time that data or other content will be retained by the Service and the maximum storage space that will be
          allotted on Tagpros&rsquo;s servers on your behalf. You agree that Tagpros has no responsibility or liability
          for the deletion or failure to store any data or other content maintained or uploaded by the Service. You
          acknowledge that Tagpros reserves the right to terminate accounts that are inactive for an extended period of
          time. You further acknowledge that Tagpros reserves the right to change these general practices and limits at
          any time, in its sole discretion, with or without notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Class Recordings:</strong>&nbsp;Classes that take place through Tagpros&rsquo;s video chat platform
          are automatically recorded by Tagpros (&ldquo;Class Recordings&rdquo;). We value student and Teacher privacy,
          and our use of Class Recordings is extremely limited. Specifically, Class Recordings are made available only
          to the Teacher providing the Class in question, in order to allow them to (1) provide a viewable copy to
          students who missed the Class, or who wish to review the Class, for their personal educational purposes; and
          (2) review the Class Recording personally in order to improve their Classes. Please note that in some cases,
          Classes are taught by a Teacher that is actually an organization, group, or team of instructors. In such
          cases, Class Recordings may be accessed by the organization, and access would not necessarily be limited to a
          single individual instructor. In addition, Tagpros may use Class Recordings to provide feedback to Teachers,
          to improve our Services, for customer support, and for compliance purposes. Tagpros retains Class Recordings
          for six months after the date of the applicable Class, subject to our Privacy Policy, after which they are
          deleted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tagpros will also delete Class Recordings earlier than six months
          under the following circumstances: (a) upon the request of a Parent for the deletion of their child&rsquo;s
          personally identifiable information, or (b) upon the reasonable determination of Tagpros that a Class
          Recording should be removed to protect the privacy of certain Users or because of violations of these Terms of
          Service. We will not use Class Recordings containing images of you (or your children) for promotional or any
          other purposes without your express written consent.&nbsp;
          <strong>
            By using the services, you consent to you and/or your child appearing in Class Recordings for the limited
            purposes set forth above.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Certain Teacher Obligations</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Teacher, you must provide Tagpros with any information requested in order for Tagpros to list your
          Classes through its Services including but not limited to a description of the Classes and the price for the
          Classes. Tagpros has sole discretion as to which Classes we list on the marketplace and we reserve the right
          to reject any Classes or remove Classes from the marketplace for any reason. Additionally, Tagpros has
          discretion to edit Class descriptions as needed to conform them to our marketplace standards. Tagpros has sole
          discretion as to which Teachers are accepted into the marketplace and we reserve the right to reject any
          potential Teacher and remove or suspend any Teacher from the marketplace for any reason. Tagpros may, but is
          not required to, conduct background checks on and interviews of Teachers in its discretion and solely for its
          own benefit. As a Teacher, you agree to provide written and/or electronic consent to such background checks
          and to participate truthfully in such interviews.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you join the Tagpros community, you agree to follow our policies, including our community standards.
          Those expectations include thoughtful and professional communications with our community (colleagues, parents,
          children), modeling appropriate behavior for our learners, and acting professionally. In addition, you agree
          to use social media, blogs, and other online forums, in an appropriate manner. Inappropriate behavior in any
          Tagpros-affiliated online forum includes, but is not limited to: behavior intended to provoke, bully, demean,
          or cause harm to others, or to create conflict; or any other posts or content that Tagpros, in its discretion,
          believes to be unconducive to a respectful and welcoming community for all. Inappropriate behavior in any
          online forum includes, but is not limited to: posting online or speaking to the media on Tagpros&rsquo;s
          behalf without prior written authorization from Tagpros; posts that Tagpros, in its discretion, finds to be
          offensive or inappropriate based on race, sex, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression,
          national origin, disability or medical condition, veteran status, or any other legally protected
          characteristic; derogatory, disparaging, or disrespectful comments about learners, teachers, parents, or
          Tagpros staff, even if the target is not identified by name; sharing any private material, communication, or
          information regarding parents of learners, including but not limited to students&rsquo; or parents&rsquo;
          names, photos, conversations, emails, student academic or performance information, screenshots of student
          work, or any other personal identifying information; posts that may be harmful to Tagpros&rsquo;s ongoing
          business operations; sharing content that contains or promotes hate speech, threats of violence, or the
          endangerment of children; and any other violation of Tagpros&rsquo;s community standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each Teacher is solely responsible for obtaining all licenses and other permissions required to offer or
          provide any Classes, and Tagpros assumes no responsibility for a Teacher's failure to obtain such licenses or
          permissions or otherwise comply with any applicable laws, rules or regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          You understand and agree that Tagpros is not an insurer, agent or employer for you as a Teacher. If a Parent
          purchases any of your Classes, any agreement you enter into with such Parent is between you and the Parent,
          and Tagpros is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tagpros is authorized to serve as your
          limited agent purely for the purpose of accepting payments from Parents on your behalf and transmitting such
          payments to you (minus our Fees). You acknowledge and agree that, as a Teacher, you are responsible for your
          own acts and omissions while using the Services. With the sole exception of students enrolled in the
          applicable Class, and/or their Parents, you further agree that you will not share any Class Recordings made
          available to you by Tagpros to any third parties. Allowing other Teachers within your organization to view the
          Class Recordings, however, is permissible.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the extent that you are using the Services as a Teacher, you agree to abide by the terms of
          our&nbsp;Teacher Guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Payment Terms</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>General:</strong>&nbsp;Each Parent agrees to pay all applicable fees for Classes (&ldquo;Enrollment
          Fees&rdquo;) as set forth on the Site. All Enrollment Fees are payable in the currency specified on the Site
          at the time of purchase. You shall be responsible for all taxes associated with the Services other than U.S.
          taxes based on Company&rsquo;s net income. Parent hereby authorizes Tagpros to bill Parent&rsquo;s payment
          instrument upon confirmation of a purchase, and Parent further agrees to pay any charges so incurred. If
          Parent disputes any charges you must let Tagpros know within sixty (60) days after the date that Tagpros
          charges you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Teacher Payment:</strong>&nbsp;Tagpros will transfer the Enrollment Fees to Teacher&rsquo;s Paypal
          account for each sale of a Class (or set of Classes, as applicable) to a Parent within a reasonable period of
          time, minus Tagpros&rsquo;s service fees (&ldquo;Tagpros Fee&rdquo;), according to the schedule and policies
          detailed in our&nbsp;Teachers Guide. In order to transfer funds to Teacher&rsquo;s Paypal account, Teacher
          shall sign up for a Paypal account. Tagpros has discretion to act on behalf of the Parent, and to not transfer
          the Enrollment Fees to Teacher, if Parent reports that the Classes were not provided or adequately completed.
          This may include but is not limited to circumstances where a Teacher did not arrive for a Class or a Class was
          of insufficient quality. Tagpros will independently review such cases, seeking input from the Parent and/or
          the Teacher, and may decide at its sole discretion to issue a refund to the Parent. All determinations of
          Tagpros with respect to a refund shall be final and binding on the Parent and Teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Limited Payment Collections Agent:</strong>&nbsp;Each Teacher appoints Tagpros as the Teacher&rsquo;s
          limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the Enrollment Fees from Parent. Each
          User agrees that payment of Enrollment Fees by a Parent to Tagpros, as that Teacher&rsquo;s limited payment
          collection agent, shall be considered the same as a payment made directly by such Parent to the relevant
          Teacher and the Teacher will provide the relevant Classes to the Parent, as outlined on the Site, as if the
          Teacher had received payment directly. Tagpros, as limited payment collection agent for the Teacher, agrees to
          facilitate the payment of any Enrollment Fees (less the Tagpros Fee) for Classes pursuant to these Terms of
          Service unless otherwise agreed between Tagpros and the Teacher. In the event that Tagpros does not remit such
          amounts, the Teacher will have recourse only against Tagpros.

          <strong>Conditions of Use</strong>

          <strong>Copyright Complaints:</strong>&nbsp;Tagpros respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask
          our users to do the same. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright
          infringement, or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, you should notify
          Tagpros of your infringement claim in accordance with the procedure set forth below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tagpros will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under
          the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&ldquo;DMCA&rdquo;) and other applicable intellectual property laws with
          respect to any alleged or actual infringement. A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be
          emailed to Tagpros&rsquo;s Copyright Agent at <a href="mailto:scouts@tagpros.us">scouts@tagpros.us</a>{' '}
          (Subject line: &ldquo;DMCA Takedown Request&rdquo;).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the following information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright
            or other intellectual property interest;
          </li>
          <li>
            a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;
          </li>
          <li>
            a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Service, with enough
            detail that we may find it on the Service;

          <li>
            a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the
            copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law;
          </li>
          <li>
            a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your Notice is accurate and
            that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or
            intellectual property owner&rsquo;s behalf.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Counter-Notice:</strong>&nbsp;If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which
          access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the
          copyright owner&rsquo;s agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in your User Content, you
          may send a written counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>your physical or electronic signature;</li>
          <li>
            identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at
            which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
          </li>
          <li>
            a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of
            mistake or a misidentification of the content; and
          </li>
          <li>
            your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of

            service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Tagpros will send a copy of the counter-notice to the
          original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it
          in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content
          provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business
          days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.
        </p>
        <p>

            Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Agreement to Arbitrate:</strong>&nbsp;This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is
          referred to in this Terms of Service as the &ldquo;Arbitration Agreement.&rdquo; You agree that any and all
          disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Tagpros, whether arising out of or relating
          to this Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, any aspect of
          the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding
          arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you
          may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration
          Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies,
          and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering
          into this Terms of Service, you and Tagpros are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in
          a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal
          Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief:</strong>&nbsp;YOU AND
          TAGPROS AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A
          PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND
          TAGPROS AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON&rsquo;S OR
          PARTY&rsquo;S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS
          PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF)
          ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF
          NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY&rsquo;S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution:</strong>&nbsp;Tagpros is always interested in resolving disputes
          amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer&rsquo;s
          satisfaction by emailing customer support at&nbsp;scouts@tagpros.us. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a
          party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of
          Dispute (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;). The Notice to Tagpros should be sent to Tagpros, Inc. Lot 6 B, Blk 4 Del Rey
          St., Greenfields 3 Novaliches Q.C., <strong>Philippines</strong> (&ldquo;Notice Address&rdquo;). The Notice
          must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.
          If Tagpros and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you
          or Tagpros may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer
          made by Tagpros or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the
          amount, if any, to which you or Tagprosl is entitled.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Arbitration Procedures:</strong>&nbsp;Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in
          accordance with the American Arbitration Association&rsquo;s (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) rules and procedures,
          including the AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the &ldquo;AAA
          Rules&rdquo;), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its
          website,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adr.org/">https://www.adr.org/</a>. Information about the AAA Rules and
          fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA&rsquo;s consumer arbitration page,&nbsp;
          <a href="https://www.adr.org/consumer">https://www.adr.org/consumer</a>. If there is any inconsistency between
          any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration
          Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration
          Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the
          provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including,
          but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration
          Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other
          judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court
          can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are
          enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless Tagpros and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient
          location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.
          If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for
          $10,000 or less, Tagpros agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the
          basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as
          established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the
          AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a
          reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
          based.

          <strong>Costs of Arbitration:</strong>&nbsp;Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
          (collectively, the &ldquo;Arbitration Fees&rdquo;) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise
          provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request,
          Tagpros will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to
          demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or
          if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of
          the Arbitration Fees, Tagpros will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the
          arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Tagpros
          will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from
          being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys&rsquo; fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Confidentiality:</strong>&nbsp;All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or
          award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Severability:</strong>&nbsp;If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this
          Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled &ldquo;Prohibition of Class and Representative
          Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&rdquo; above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace
          such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
          expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement
          shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of
          subsection (b) above titled &ldquo;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized
          Relief&rdquo; are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and
          void. The remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.
