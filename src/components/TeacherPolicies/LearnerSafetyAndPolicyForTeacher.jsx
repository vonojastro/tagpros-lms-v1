          When you join the Tagpros community, you’re agreeing to follow our policies.
          Those expectations include thoughtful and professional communications with our
          community (colleagues, parents, children), modeling appropriate behavior for our
          learners, and acting professionally.
        </p>
        <p>
          This social contract – to treat your community with respect and grace – doesn’t
          just end when you take your “teacher” hat off and log out of your Tagpros
          classes. Your contract continues with your use of social media, blogs, and other
          online forums, which we encourage you to participate in. They can provide
          terrific opportunities to share educational resources, market your classes,
          network, and share private and personal information and views. While we
          certainly wouldn’t tell you either how to live your best life as an influencer
          or what Facebook groups to join, we do ask that you continue to use your best
          judgment and be aware that your audience may include your Tagpros peers,
          community, and learners (many of whom are Google pros!).

        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of the topic you are teaching or the age group you are working with,
          you have a responsibility to create a safe online classroom environment. For
          this reason, teachers are required to teach all live classes on Jitsi through
          the Tagpros platform. While parents are responsible for supervising their kids,
          we expect that you teach your classes in a way that encourages physical safety,
          mental wellbeing, and online privacy for all students. Poor judgment on safety
          and privacy can result in teacher restriction and removal.{' '}

          As the teacher, you should be present and supervise your meeting at all times.

          Jitsi is open and your live class is running.{' '}

          behavior problems arise.

        <p>
          Ensure that all learners have their video enabled, or if they don’t, that you've
          interacted with them at least once over video to verify their identity. This can
          be a quick check-in at the beginning of the first class meeting. We encourage
          learners to enable their audio/video during the rest of class to create a more
          social experience for all learners, but it’s not required (some learners feel
          safer with video off). If you’ve never before seen a learner on video and
          they’re unable or unwilling to enable their video, please: (1) gently explain
          our policy, (2) let them know you’ll follow up after class, and (3) remove them
          from class. If a safety related incident occurs during one of your classes,
          contact Tagpros support immediately to let us know:{' '}

          If your lesson requires the learners to use any materials that could be
          potentially dangerous, such as sharp objects in a cooking class, make sure you
          designate time at the beginning of class to discuss the proper way to use/handle
          these materials. Or if your class involves a discussion on a topic, such as how
          to cope with anxiety, that may trigger more serious emotional responses, you
          should first make sure that your learners are equipped with the right skillset
          to participate in these conversations. In order to set the right expectations
          for prospective parents, you should also include this information in the
          parental guidance section of the class listing.

          <Bold>Sensitive topics</Bold>
        </p>
        <p>
          For teachers offering classes on any sort of sensitive topic, as defined in our
          class content policy, we ask that you take extra measures to ensure the safety
          of your learners. We encourage you to take the time to anticipate potential
          issues that may arise proactively. This could range from emotionally-difficult
          topics you might discuss as a part of the lesson, to follow-up questions your
          learners may have.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure learner safety, discussions related to personal mental health issues -
          like depression, suicide, or abuse - are not allowed on our platform. If a
          learner initiates a conversation about a sensitive topic, please gently explain
          that Jitsi classes are not the appropriate venue for these discussions and
          redirect your learners to a new topic. If you are concerned about a learner's
          safety, contact Tagpros:{' '}

          <Bold>Learner behavior</Bold>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a teacher, you may encounter situations in which a learner's behavior merits
          special attention. Perhaps it's a learner who appears to be a bully (or be
          bullied), or who behaves inappropriately, or whose behavior suggests trouble at
          home. It’s your responsibility to address learner behavior as part of classroom
          management, and to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for all learners. as
          a part of the lesson, to follow-up questions your learners may have.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ask that you share any concerning incidents with Tagpros support, and we will
          work with you to resolve them. That may involve helping to contact the learner's
          parents, or just in helping you decide how to proceed.{' '}

          <Bold>Responsibility to report</Bold>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you believe a learner's safety may be in jeopardy, you should first encourage
          the learner to call your community police department and then report the
          situation to Tagpros support. In addition, you may have a legal responsibility
          to report based on your occupation and your location. Tagpros cannot advise on
          your personal responsibility to report.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tagpros acts as a voluntary reporter. When we discover situations in which a
          learner may be at risk, we will report to the appropriate authority. If a
          teacher has an individual responsibility to report, we will work with you to
          decide which party will report the situation.

          <Bold>Learner privacy</Bold>
        </p>
        <p>
          As Tagpros teacher, you are also responsible for maintaining learner privacy
          online. As a general rule, you shouldn’t reveal or encourage students to reveal
          any personal information about an individual student or a student’s family.
          Personal information can include, but is not limited to, a student’s full name,
          birthdate, personal email address, address, or phone number. Asking learners to
          share their location at the country, state, or city level is OK, provided you
          give kids an option to not share if they prefer not to.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to not sharing personal information about your students, you also
          should not share any private information about your classes outside of class.
          This includes student voices (audio), student first names, or student faces. For
          example, you shouldn’t share a photo or video of you interacting with your
          students on your social media page.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to share any completed student work, such as a student essay
          or art project, you will need to first obtain parent permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since classes are recorded, it is also important to protect learner privacy on
          the screen. In cases where learners have revealed personal information or
          otherwise breached their privacy on camera, you should turn off their camera so
          that it is not captured by other learners. You can then send the learner a
          private chat through Jitsi Meet to let them know what is in view of their camera
          without disrupting the class further. For more information on how to do this,
          please visit our videos on For Teachers. After class, you should reach out to
          the parent of the learner in question and the Tagpros Trust & Safety team{' '}
          <a href='mailto:cmpalabrica@tagpros.org' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>
            cmpalabrica@tagpros.org
          </a>
          . In cases where learner privacy is compromised, Tagpros may choose to delete a
          recording.

        </p>
        <p>In general, you should keep all communication on Tagpros.</p>
        <p>
          Learners may want to keep in touch with their classmates after your class ends
          and may ask to exchange contact information in Jitsi chat or the Classroom page.
          In order to protect learner privacy and continue to ensure they have a safe
          experience, parents should give consent before learners share this information
          with each other. Parents may message each other directly from the "For Parents"
          tab on the Classroom page.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that we also ask you not to share your personal contact information with

          When choosing other third party tools to help run your class, please consider
          their approach to learner privacy and safety. If you would like to use another
          site that requires signing up for a new account, make sure you go through the
          complete sign-up process ahead of time to find out if that site has any age
          restrictions in place. If there is a minimum age requirement, do not encourage
          learners to lie about their age. You should instead disclose this in the
          parental guidance section of your class listing and explain that the parents
          will need to create an account with their learners.

        <p>
          Regardless of whether or not the individual is an approved Tagpros teacher, we
          do not allow substitutes of any kind. We understand that unexpected emergencies
          or illnesses may occasionally arise at the last minute, preventing you from
          teaching your class. When this happens, you should cancel the meeting and
          communicate with the parents to arrange a make up meeting. The Tagpros support
          team is happy to provide assistance when emergencies arise.

          If you would like to bring on a guest speaker to help enhance your lesson, you
          are welcome to do so! This individual does not need to be an approved Tagpros
          teacher, but we do require that you are still present at all times. If you have
          a specific situation that you aren’t sure about, contact our support team and we
          will help you navigate this situation.{' '}
