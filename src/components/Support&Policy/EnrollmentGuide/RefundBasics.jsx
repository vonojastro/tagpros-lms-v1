      <h3>Refund policies</h3>
      <b>For Live Classes</b>
      <p>
        If the learner or parent choose to cancel their enrollment in the class at least
        24 hours before the published start of the class, they will be eligible for a full
        refund.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Refunds for cancelling the enrollment after the 24 hour grace period will be
        subject to the evaluation of the Tagpros Admin.
      </p>
      <b>Teacher’s makeup session</b>
      <p>
        For classes with <b>three or more</b> sessions, teachers are eligible for a makeup
        session. The makeup session is an extra scheduled session of class that may be
        used when a teacher is unable to meet the learners on another scheduled day of
        class.
      </p>
      <b>Teacher absences</b>
      <p>
        Should the teacher miss <b>two or more</b> sessions, the entire class will be
        canceled and full refunds will be provided to enrolled students.
      </p>
      <b>How we handle refunds</b>
      <p>
        The teacher will return the money to us in the event of a refund, and we will then
        give it to the parent or learner. To make sure that all reimbursements are secure
        and properly documented, we do not allow direct transactions between teachers and
        parents. Refunds will be processed through PayPal and credited to the Tagpros
        account you are currently logged into.
      </p>
      <b>Payment gateway fees</b>
      <p>
        Our payment gateway (PayPal) charges a service fee of around $1 per transaction.
        However, depending on the circumstances of the case, Tagpros may waive the
        deduction of the payment gateway fees from the full refund.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tagpros reserves the right to change payment and refund policies without prior
        notice.

      <h3>Payment Policies</h3>
      <b>For classes with 6 sessions or less</b>
      <p>
        The teacher will receive payment for the class within 5-10 working days after the
        last session of the course.
      </p>
      <b>For classes with more than 6 sessions</b>
      <p>
        The payment will be given through installments, which will be paid within 5
        working days at the end of each month within the duration of the course.
      </p>
      <b>How do I get paid?</b>
      <p>
        Teachers are required to have a working Paypal account because all payments are
        made through Paypal. Tagpros’ development team is working hard to enable payments
        through other channels, but Paypal is the only option for now.
      </p>
      <b>Currency of the payout</b>
      <p>
        We will be handing out the payments via PayPal in USD. It will be under the
        teacher’s discretion on when he\she will covert the payment into PHP.

      <b>Teacher’s makeup session</b>
