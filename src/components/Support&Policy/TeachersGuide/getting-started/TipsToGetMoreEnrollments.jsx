      <h3>Experiment with your classes</h3>
      <p>
        Feel free to experiment with your classes with different titles, age ranges,
        duration, etc. This also includes your teaching strategies, content, and type of
        class. It will also be helpful if you keep a record of the number of enrollees for
        each of your classes to easily compare different approaches.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Share your classes</h3>
      <p>
        You can also expand the reach of your classes by sharing your classes on different
        social media such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Respond quickly to inquiries</h3>
      <p>
        Your classes have a “Send Message” button that allows parents and learners to
        contact you even before enrolling in your class. Try to be responsive and as clear
        as possible when answering their questions or concerns.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Experiment with class pricing</h3>
      <p>
        Lower pricing for your classes will result in a higher number of enrollments. Of
        course, lowering the price too much will also reduce your potential profits. Feel
        free to experiment with different pricing with your classes to see which price
        ranges work best.
