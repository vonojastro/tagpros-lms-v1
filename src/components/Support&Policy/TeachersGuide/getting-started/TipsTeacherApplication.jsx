        Once you have created a teachers account at our website, you will have to submit a
        Teacher Application for our team to have an idea on who you are and what you want
        to teach. To help you with that, here are some traits that we are looking for in a
        Tagpros teacher:

        <li>Experienced with handling young learners</li>
        <li>Have excellent verbal and written communication skills</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        After receiving your teacher application, we will check the supporting materials
        and respond to you within 3-5 business days. You can reapply if your initial
        application was rejected. You may submit up to three times. Here are some
