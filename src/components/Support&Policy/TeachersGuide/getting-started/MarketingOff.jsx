        and support you. You may consider the following forms of marketing:
      </p>

        <li>Posting videos</li>
        <li>Social media</li>
        <li>Local engagement</li>

        If you already do some of these activities or have the relevant accounts setup,
        then here are our suggestions:
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Blog</h3>
      <p>
        If you have a blog or website, consider writing about your classes and experience
        teaching on Tagpros. You have a story to tell about why you teach and how you
        designed your classes. Maybe you have a unique approach or educational philosophy
        to share. By telling your story and linking to your profile and classes, you can
        ask your audience to consider enrolling.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do blog, then please share the post in our teacher and parent Facebook
        groups. Also, communicate through our Chatbot Support to let us know about your
        writing so our community team can look to link to you from our social media
        channels.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Post videos</h3>
      <p>
        Tagpros classes are interactive and mostly live, so recording a video is a great
        way to show parents what you will be like in class. Post your videos to Youtube,
        Instagram, and Facebook to engage your audience and have them consider your
        classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may already have videos that you recorded for your teacher profile, or you can
        record new ones to tell stories about your background and classes. Here are some
        ideas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Fun facts” about your subject area</li>
        <li>Short tutorials or lessons in your subject area</li>
        <li>Tips for teaching or learning online</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If possible, include samples of work that you or learners have created. When you
        post videos on social media, email supports us at{' '}
        <a href='customercare@tagpros.us' target='_blank'>
          customercare@tagpros.us
        </a>{' '}
        or contact us via our Chatbot Support at our <a href='/'>website</a> to let us
        know so our community team can look to link you to our social media channels.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Engage on social media</h3>
      <p>
        If you have social media accounts then consider posting about your classes and
        teaching on Tagpros. You can engage your audience with stories about the fun
        activities happening in your class. Get ideas on the kind of content to post by
        asking other teachers what they do on social media on our{' '}

      <h3>Local Engagement</h3>
      <p>
        Feel free to contact people you know and advertise your classes to them! It never
        hurts to invite more people to learn from your classes. If you are already a
        teacher, then you can also tell your students and fellow teachers to check out
        your classes.
