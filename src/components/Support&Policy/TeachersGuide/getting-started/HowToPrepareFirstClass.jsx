        <b>Have your learner practice the following:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Turn off / turn on the microphone</li>
        <li>Turn off / turn on the video</li>

        <li>Click the 'Chat' button and type 'hello!' into the chat box</li>
      </ul>

        <b>4. Prepare for class</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Review the{' '}
          <a href='/policies/tagpros-community/community-code-of-conduct' target='_blank'>
            Learner Code of Conduct
          </a>{' '}
          with your learner.
        </li>
        <li>
          Always check every learnerâ€™s identity before the class. This means seeing them
          via video or audio at least once every class. Tell all learners and parents that
          they should inform you if connecting through video is not possible. You should
          ask to confirm their identity or presence by speaking with the teacher usually
          before the online class start.
        </li>
        <li>
          Find a quiet place for your learner to attend the class that is not disruptive
          to the class or other learners.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure that any required materials are ready before class starts. Your
          teacher will let you know in the classroom if your learner needs to bring
          anything to class.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Five Minutes Before Class Startsâ€¦</h3>
      <p>
        <b>5. Go to the classroom</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Log in at Tagpros</li>
        <li>Click "Schedule" </li>
        <li>Click on the class title</li>
        <li>Select the "classroom" tab</li>
        <li>Click the button that says "join meeting"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you see a message that says "Please wait for the host to start the meeting" -
        be patient! Your teacher will arrive soon! That's it! You're ready to start
        learning! ðŸŽ‰
