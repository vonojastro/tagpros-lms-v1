      <p>Here are elements that make for a good class experience:</p>
      <h3>Before the class</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Familiarize yourself with Jitsi.</b> Check out our guide on using the video
          conferencing app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Do a test run.</b> Try to run a practice meeting to see how you look on
          camera and understand how Jitsi works. Make sure that your face can be seen
          clearly by the students.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Prepare for each class.</b> Have a lesson plan before entering each class.
          Make sure that your learners will have the opportunity to interact with you or
          with each other to enhance their learning. Try to ask questions the students can
          answer, facilitate discussion among yourselves, and reward good questions from
          the students.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Enter the meeting early.</b> The students should not be waiting for you when
          they arrive. This way, they can also ask questions during that time. Make sure
          that your camera is always on so the students can see you.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>During the class</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Introduction.</b> In your first class meeting, you should introduce yourself
          and have the students introduce themselves and share their experience with the
          subject you will be teaching. This will allow you to have an idea of which
          approach will work better.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ask the students to mute themselves unless speaking.</b> This will help you
          continue your meeting without any distractions. If someoneâ€™s mic is not muted,
          you can message them privately to let them know.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Raise hand feature.</b> Let your students know the raise hand feature and
          that they should use it if they wish to speak.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>What to do if no students are present.</b> If no learners are present 10
          minutes after the start time of your class, exit the meeting and notify all the
          learners that you have left the meeting. You may offer a makeup class some other
          time if you want.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>After the class</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Ask the students/parents to leave a review.</b> At the end of your class, ask
          everyone to give you feedback using the website to know where you did well and
          where you need to improve.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </Container>
