        There are many applications and websites that support teachers in offering an
        engaging learning experience. This is a selection that is popular with Tagpros
        teachers. Every tool has tradeoffs: while these tools offer unique features, it
        may prove a challenge if learners need to independently access and use them.

      <h3>Quiz or Review tools</h3>
      <p>
        These sites allow teachers to create multiple choice/quiz games for students. Many
        also have games that are already created that can be used by teachers. It may be
        best if students have a secondary device, but they can split the screen and
        participate that way as well.{' '}

        Teachers can create interactive presentations that allow the kids to directly
        participate in the class through quizzes, games, etc. There is a teacher and
        student view, so the students log on to their own view of the presentation which
        can be confusing for students if not well detailed.{' '}

        Student and teachers can work collaboratively to create boards. They can contain
        links, videos, documents, and pictures. This would be a great way for kids to use
        together to create a project, a museum display, brainstorm for KWL, etc.{' '}

        This site allows you to take video from different sources and clip it or add

        Teachers can create an outline for learners to move through, or students can
        create outlines themselves. You can aggregate multiple resources to put on the
        timeline. This can be used for anything you would teach in a progression.

        This site allows you to use several different resources and interactive activities
        to either teach new material or review content. Itâ€™s a little more time consuming
        than some, but also gives you lots of different options to use like jigsaw
        puzzles, matching, game show, multiple choice, etc.

        Students can write up a newspaper article and it generates a picture of it, just
        like a newspaper. The clapperboard allows students to put on information for a
        film they may be shooting. Other tools are just kind of fun/funny.
