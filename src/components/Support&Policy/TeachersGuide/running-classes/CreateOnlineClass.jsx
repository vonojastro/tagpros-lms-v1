      <h3>Creating a Class</h3>
      <p>
        After logging in to your teacher’s account, you can click the “+Create New Class”
        button to list start listing a class. You will have to fill up the details of the
        class which include: the title, thumbnail, summary, minimum and maximum class
        size, duration and schedule, age range, price, assessments, sources, and materials
        for the course. Once submitted, we will review the class and will get back to you
        in 3-5 business days to tell you if the class is approved. If the class was not
        approved, do not worry, we will be working with you to improve your classes to
        make sure you will give the best learning experience for your students.

      <h3>Tagpros Class Criteria</h3>
      <p>
        We want Tagpros classes to be relevant and inclusive to the widest audience, so
        parents can participate in any Tagpros class knowing they will not be subjected to
        a teacher's personal, religious, or political beliefs, as well as other
        objectionable content. Here are the three primary criteria that Tagpros want to
        see in class content:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Classes should not promote religion</li>
        <li>Classes should be based on facts and evidence</li>
        <li>Classes should be suitable for the target age</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, Tagpros classes should not promote discrimination, hate speech, or
        violence. Tagpros welcomes learners, families, and teachers across all pillars of
        diversity; this includes, but is not limited to, race, ethnicity, nationality,
        sexual orientation, religion, and gender identity. In the case of ambiguity,
        Tagpros will decide on the allowed topics on a case-to-case basis.

      <h3>Respond to Messages</h3>
      <p>
        Once we have approved the publishing of your class, it will now be listed on our
        website and learners can now enroll in it. Your class details will contain a “Send
        Message” button that users can see. If a parent or learner wants to ask a question
        about the class, they can use that button to contact you. We recommend you be
        responsive to increase the likelihood of them enrolling in your class.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Jitsi</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, we recommend that you fully understand the features of Jitsi. This will
        allow you to facilitate the learning environment more effectively and provide a
        better experience for everyone. To learn more about Jitsi’s features, watch this
        video.
