      <p>
        We want Tagpros classes to be relevant and inclusive to the widest audience. To
        achieve this, we have created these class criteria you can follow. In the case of
        ambiguity, Tagpros will decide on the allowed topics on a case-to-case basis.
        Reach out to customercare@tagpros.us if you have any questions about a topic you
        would like to teach.
      </p>

      <h3>Classes should not promote religion:</h3>
      <p>
        Do not promote a specific religion or religious point of view. Of course, many
        classes need to address religion. For example, you can't teach history without
        talking about religion. It's important to teach about religion but you should not
        promote a particular religious worldview.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Classes should be based on facts and evidence: </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Present classes using an unbiased perspective, to the extent possible. </li>
        <li>Try to acknowledge the different perspectives if there are any.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You should avoid answering questions based on your personal beliefs. If a student
        tries to ask about your opinion, try to redirect it to a question that gives an
        unbiased answer.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Classes should be suitable for the target age:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Material that may be sensitive for young children should be highlighted in the
          class description.{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
          The use of language and material should adjust to the age of the learners.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Also, Tagpros classes should not promote discrimination, hate speech, or violence.
        Tagpros will remove teachers and classes that do not abide by these standards.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Sensitive or higher-risk topics </h3>
      <p>
        Classes that are sensitive or controversial are subject to further evaluation.
        Teachers should have the training and/or experience to teach the topic to young
        learners.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mental health and wellness</li>
        <li>Physical health, medicine, and drugs</li>
        <li>Sex education </li>
        <li>Experiences of marginalized groups</li>
        <li>Nutrition and Diet</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Medical services</h3>
      <p>
        We do not support classes that provide medical training or medical services. We do
        not offer these classes on Tagpros out of concern for learnersâ€™ safety and
        well-being. We have provided some clarifying examples below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Classes about workouts or exercise routines are allowed, but classes about
          physical therapy are not.
        </li>
        <li>
          Teaching general information about nutrition (e.g. Go, Grow, and Glow Foods) are
          allowed, but specific nutrition advice (e.g. Keto Diet) is not. Any class
          promoting weight loss is not allowed on Tagpros.
        </li>
        <li>
          Classes teaching about mental health are allowed, but classes that offer therapy
          or diagnose mental health conditions are not.{' '}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Safety hazards</h3>
      <p>
        Classes that include potential safety hazards (e.g. swimming, driving, camping)
        will be evaluated on a case-to-case basis. We will be requiring teachings that
        will be offering these topics to have a high level of expertise in the subject.
        These classes will also require parental guidance to ensure that the learners will
        have more clarity on the potential danger of such activities.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Marginalized Groups</h3>
      <p>
        Marginalized groups of people are those who have faced discrimination. Tagpros
        believes that classes based on these topics deserve special consideration. Tagpros
        has stricter criteria for evaluating these classes. We expect teachers to have the
        expertise and use credible sources in teaching these topics.{' '}
