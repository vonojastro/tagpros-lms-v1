      <h3>How educators can report their created class earnings.</h3>
      <p>
        Tagpros LMS educators are classified as independent contractors for tax reporting
        purposes. Regardless of where they are located, it is their responsibility to
        report their earnings from teaching online appropriately based on their local and
        national laws. This applies to all payment types received from Tagpros LMS
        platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        All payments to educators are handled through PayPal. Under Philippines laws and
        regulations of BIR, PayPal is required to send the teachers a comprehensive report
        and report their earnings to the BIR if they have earned more than P250,000.00 in
        a year with Tagpros and other sources and they will have to file the ITR as
        necessary as regulated under the laws. (Teachers may refer to the rulings mandated
        by the BIR for this kind of income and exceptions by LGU).{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Tagpros management does not directly provide tax reporting forms. If they did not
        receive any report from Paypal, they can ask a report of their total earnings with
        the Accounting Department of Tagpros for them to file their yearly ITR. Teachers
        have been encouraged to monitor their income received from Tagpros to determine
        their total income for the year. If they sent money back to Tagpros for Learners
        as a refund, then they should take account of that as well. Teachers can also find
        some basic information on their earnings through our Customer Service Assistant to
        relay the matter with the Accounting Department. Teachers were advised to read
        always on for more specific information released under our website for updated
        releases.

      <h3>
        For Educators teachings for other countries (e.g. United States, Canada, etc.)
      </h3>
      <p>
        PayPal provides a form for this kind of income and Tagpros determines the receipts
        as income from the Philippines transactions since the Teachers are working under
        the jurisdiction of Philippines law. Therefore, all income received in the
        Philippines and all other countries shall be reported with the BIR under the
        guidelines as regulated and adjusted per BIR Circulars.
