        Tagpros policies indicate that all classes and events should start on time. This
        is in consideration of everyone who paid and made time to learn in your class.
        However, if you need to cancel or reschedule a class, you should do the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Post a public announcement in the classroom to notify all parents and learners.
        </li>
        <li>Cancel the meeting in your teacherâ€™s account</li>
        <li>
          Schedule a makeup session on a different date and notify all parents and
          learners.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Please coordinate with all parents and learners who are enrolled in your
              class to see which time will work best for everyone.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please note that recorded classes are not currently supported by Tagpros and are
        not a viable substitute for a canceled meeting.
      </p>

      <h3>Emergency Circumstances</h3>
      <p>
        If situations arise where you are not capable of notifying the parents that you
        will not be able to attend a session 24 hours or more before the starting time,
        then try to communicate with us and we will do the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Notify parents by posting an announcement to the classroom wall on your behalf.
        </li>
        <li>Cancel the session if needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You should try to schedule a make-up session with your class once you are capable
        of communicating with the parents and students again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are our different contact options to ease your communication with us in the

        If you are capable of responding 24 hours or more before the start time of the
        class, then we ask that you manage the class during that time. We are happy to
        help you if such situations arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are not reachable for any reason for more than 24 hours before and after
        the class time, then we will assume that you tried to do your part and will wait
        for your response. We will be evaluating these issues on a case-to-case basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case that you will be experiencing a long-term issue that will hinder your
        capacity to teach the class, please let us know about the details and we will help
        you. These are some of the options we can provide in the case that you will be
        needing a break:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Take a leave of absence and return when possible.</li>
        <li>Reschedule the class to a later date.</li>
        <li>Cancel the class and issue refunds to the parents.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We will evaluate the situations on a case-to-case basis and will help you find
        options so that you can continue teaching from your side.
