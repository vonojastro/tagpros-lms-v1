        It is important to note that when a teacher is removed from the platform, he/she
        is no longer allowed to apply again. With this, we have created a list of cases
        that we want you to know to avoid complications.

        Additionally, to help ensure parents see relevant content, we typically unlist
        classes if they appear inactive. A class will be unlisted if there are no active
        or future sections and no new sections have been created in the past 12 months. In
        the case that a teacher has no active sections of any classes in the last 6
        months, all classes may be unlisted. If you have been unlisted solely due to
        inactivity, simply submit your classes for approval again. Outschool has sole
        discretion to remove teachers or classes from the platform, with or without prior
        notice to you.
