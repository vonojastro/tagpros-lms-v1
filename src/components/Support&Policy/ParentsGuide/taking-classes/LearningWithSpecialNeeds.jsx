        In our effort to provide education to everyone, we at Tagpros place a strong
        emphasis on diversity. Having said that, we also want our platform to be
        accessible to learners with special needs. Here are our suggestions for you on how
        to create a community that can support children with special needs:
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Teachers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          List on your profile any experience or credentials with special education.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can create a class that specifically caters to learners with special needs
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Parents</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If your children have special needs and you want to enroll them in a class,
          message the teacher if he/she can accommodate adding your children to the class.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can contact us regarding the needs of your children at
          <a href='mailto:customercare@tagpros.us' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>
            customercare@tagpros.us
          </a>
          . We will be happy to help you find classes and options that will help your
          children navigate our platform.
        </li>
      </ul>
