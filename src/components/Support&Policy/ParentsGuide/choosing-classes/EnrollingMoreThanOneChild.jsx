      <h3>Can I enroll more than one learner under my account in the same class?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, as long as there is a slot for learners in the class, you can enroll as many
        students in the same class; however, here at Tagpros, we want our students to
        interact with others as much as possible. Because of this, we encourage the
        learners to still interact with other students and the teacher as well as use
        separate devices if possible.{' '}

      <h3>Do you provide discounts for siblings or multiple kids?</h3>
      <p>
        Discounts or promos for multiple learners under one account(parent) are not
        available at Tagpros. However, you can discuss with the teacher for classes where
        you are planning to enroll multiple children in and ask if they are willing to
        give you a discount.
