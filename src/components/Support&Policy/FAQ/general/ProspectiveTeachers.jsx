      <h3>What classes can I teach?</h3>
      <p>
        You can teach anything you want! As long as you are passionate and knowledgeable
        about what you want to teach, we will do our best to support you. You can also
        look around our{' '}
        <a href='https://tagpros.us/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>
          website
        </a>{' '}
        to find inspiration from other classes.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>What can I earn?</h3>
      <p>
        You will earn 70% of the payments for your class. That being said, you will be the
        one to price your classes and you can experiment which pricing works best.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Do I have to pay to teach?</h3>

        You donâ€™t have to pay us anything to teach at Tagpros! Just bring your passion and
        expertise and we will be happy to provide you with our services.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Can I promote classes sold elsewhere here?</h3>
      <p>
        No. We want to provide the learners with classes that our partnered teachers have
        created; thus, we will only allow the promotion of classes from our website.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Time Zones</h3>
      <p>
        Upon creation, you will be the one to set the timezone of the class. Then that
        class will be viewed on the class catalog depending on the user's IP address and
        timezone. We recommend that you check the time zones of different countries that
        could have enrollments to know which time slots will work best for your class.
