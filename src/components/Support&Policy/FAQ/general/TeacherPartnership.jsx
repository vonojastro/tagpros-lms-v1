      <h3>What is Tagpros Education Marketplace?</h3>
      <p>
        A digital learning community called Tagpros Education Marketplace provides K–12
        students with a range of small-sized, additional after-school online sessions.

        offer an option to help disengaged students rekindle their love and passion for
        learning while allowing dedicated instructors the flexibility and freedom to teach
        in novel and innovative ways.

        convenience.

        Who will identify the pricing of each class? How much will I earn? Will it be per
        class or per head? How will the payment be to the Teacher Partners?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The teacher will be paid for each learner in his or her class. The teacher can
        select the price of his or her class from a range of prices recommended by
        Tagpros.{' '}

          <u>The teacher earns 70% of net revenues from the class</u>

        so applicable taxes are withheld in accordance with Philippine tax regulations.{' '}
