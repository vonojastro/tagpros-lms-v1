      <h3>What is Tagpros?</h3>
      <p>
        We give teachers a platform to design their courses and post them on our website.
        We also help in promoting the classes that the teachers create to expand their
        reach. Our main goal is to develop small-group, interactive, live online
        classrooms that will undoubtedly improve your kids' educational experiences.
        Numerous subjects are available at Tagpros, including music, science, math, and
        many others. To see if a course interests you, look through our course schedule.

      <h3>How do you ensure the quality of your classes?</h3>
      <p>
        Our team conducts an extensive review of the background of prospective teachers
        who want to join Tagpros. We also check demo lessons, and expertise on the
        subjects, and even scrutinize every class before the teachers can publish their
        courses. Tagpros always interacts with their teachers to further polish their
        crafts to make sure that all of our partnered teachers will produce the best
        classes for the learners.

      <h3>How does Tagpros ensure safety in classes?</h3>
      <p>
        At Tagpros, we place a high priority on student safety. We do this by implementing
        a learner's verification system, which enables our teachers to guarantee the
        safety of their pupils. We have established a procedure for students to turn on
        their cameras during class to verify that no one is older than 18. The pupils will
        be required to verify their identity by speaking with the teacher before the start
        of each session if they are now able to turn on their video.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>How much do our classes cost? How do I pay?</h3>
      <p>
        Classes on Tagpros require a fee to enroll. Each class is priced depending on the
        teacherâ€™s preference and the price guidelines provided by our platform. Generally,
        our class prices range from 3-20 USD. Currently, payments for our class are done
        via Paypal. To learn more, see our guideline for paying for classes.

      <h3>Is there a discount if I enroll multiple students in one class?</h3>
      <p>
        Discounts or promos for multiple learners under one account(parent) are not
        available at Tagpros. However, you can discuss with the teacher for classes where
        you are planning to enroll multiple children in and ask if they are willing to
        give you a discount.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>What are the devices that I need for Tagpros?</h3>
      <p>
        Our website can be accessed on all major web browsers. For our live classes, we
        use Jitsi as our live video platform to facilitate the discussions. For this, you
        will need to have a webcam, microphone, and a reliable internet connection. To
        learn more about Jitsi, we encourage you to watch this{' '}
