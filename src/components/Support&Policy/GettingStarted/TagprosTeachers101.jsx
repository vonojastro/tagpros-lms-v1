          create an account
        </a>{' '}
        on our website to join Tagpros. Make sure to create a teacher’s account during
        the registration. If you choose not to sign up using Gmail or Facebook, you will
        be prompted to verify your email address. Once you have registered and{' '}
        <a href='/login' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>
          logged in
        </a>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Teacher Application</h3>
      <p>
        The teacher application allows us to get to know you more and have an idea of
        what you want to teach. You will be required to put the following:

      <ul>
        <li>Basic Information</li>
        <li>Class Descriptions</li>
        <li>3-5-minute sample class video</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once you have submitted your teacher application, we will review the documents
        and will get back to you after 3-5 business days. If your application was
        denied, you can still try again. We allow up to 3 submissions.

      <h3>Preparing for your First Class</h3>
      <p>
        For our live classes, we use{' '}
        <a href='https://meet.jit.si/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>
          Jitsi
        </a>{' '}
        as our live video platform to facilitate the discussions. For this, you will
        need to have a webcam, microphone, and a reliable internet connection. To learn
        more about Jitsi, we encourage you to watch this video. However, certain
        teachers may require certain materials for the class to be maximized.
