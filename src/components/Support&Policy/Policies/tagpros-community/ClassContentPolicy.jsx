      <h3>Tagpros classes should be objective, secular, and age-appropriate</h3>
      <p>
        Tagpros classes should be objective, secular, and age-appropriate. We have adopted
        this policy so that Tagpros classes can be relevant and inclusive to the widest
        audience, and so parents can participate in any Tagpros class knowing they will
        not be subjected to a teacher's personal, religious, or political beliefs, as well
        as other objectionable content. We limit classes in certain sensitive areas that
        are detailed further below.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Classes should be secular:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not promote a specific religion or religious point of view.</li>
        <li>
          Present facts, ideas, and theories that are grounded in science and accepted by
          the preponderance of experts in a field.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Of course, many classes need to address religion - for example, you can't teach
        history without talking about religion. It's critical to teach about religion, but
        to not promote or advocate a particular religious worldview.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Classes should be objective and accurate: </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Classes should be based on fact and evidence.</li>
        <li>Classes should be based on fact and evidence.</li>
        <li>
          Acknowledge and present multiple viewpoints that exist on many social,
          political, and historical issues.
        </li>
        <li>Do not use classes as a soapbox for personal viewpoints.</li>
        <li>
          Text, images and content should not be sensationalized. Classes should not be
          designed to provoke an emotional response at the expense of accuracy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the course of class discussion, students may raise questions about a teacher's
        personal viewpoints. In most cases, you should aim to deflect or redirect the
        question, rather than allowing your personal belief to influence students.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Classes should be age-appropriate:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Material that may be disturbing to young children should be highlighted in the
          class description
        </li>
        <li>
          Material that may be objectionable to parents should be made clear - for
          example, topics are violent or sexual in nature, or that touch on sensitive
          political questions
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, Tagpros classes may not promote discrimination, hate speech, or
        violence. Tagpros welcomes learners, families, and teachers across all pillars of
        diversity; this includes, but is not limited to, race, ethnicity, nationality,
        sexual orientation, religion, and gender identity.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Teachers and classes that do not abide by these standards will be removed from
        Tagpros.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Sensitive or higher-risk topics </h3>
      <p>
        There are classes that are not allowed on the platform, or are subject to higher
        scrutiny, because of their sensitive or potentially controversial nature.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        For these topic areas we require the teacher to have training and/or experience
        teaching the topic to young learners.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mental health and wellness</li>
        <li>Physical health, medicine, and drugs</li>
        <li>Sex education </li>
        <li>Experiences of marginalized groups</li>
        <li>Nutrition and Diet</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We have additional requirements for the following types of classes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Medical services</h3>
      <p>
        We do not support classes that provide medical training or medical services. This
        includes, but is not limited to, first aid, CPR, therapy, counseling, psychiatric
        evaluations, or evaluations for special education services. We do not offer these
        classes on Tagpros out of concern for learners’ safety and well-being. We
        recognize that many classes can touch on these subjects, so we have provided some
        clarifying examples below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Classes offering workouts or exercise routines are allowed, but classes offering
          physical therapy are considered medical services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Classes teaching general information about nutrition or a type of diet (eg. What
          is veganism?) are allowed, but classes with targeted nutrition advice to
          learners are considered medical services and require more expertise. They may
          not be appropriate for the Tagpros platform. All class subject matter must be
          science/fact based, and not promote any single perspective on nutrition and
          diet. For example, teaching what Vitamin D does for your body would be okay for
          someone with a basic understanding, but teaching how to get enough Vitamin D
          requires additional expertise. Any class promoting weight loss is not allowed on
          Tagpros.
        </li>
        <li>
          Classes offering information about mental health or non-medical symptom
          management strategies are allowed, but classes offering individual or group
          therapy targeted towards learners with diagnosed medical conditions, trauma, or
          grief are considered a medical service. For example, classes offering techniques
          to handle day-to-day stress or anxiety are allowed, but classes offering
          therapeutic support specifically for learners suffering from chronic anxiety or
          anxiety disorders would be a medical service. Social support groups, such as for
          military children or learners with other shared experience, are not usually
          considered a medical service but will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis as a
          sensitive/experts only topic.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Safety hazards</h3>
      <p>
        Classes that present a higher risk for potential safety hazards will be evaluated
        on a case-by-case basis. Examples include, but are not limited to, classes on
        swimming, driving, or wilderness survival techniques. For classes that are
        appropriate for the platform, we will require teachers to have a high level of
        professional training, expertise, or experience working with youth in the subject.
        Additionally, we require teachers to provide extensive parental guidance
        information.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Pseudoscience and supernatural topics</h3>
      <p>
        For topics that may be considered pseudoscience or supernatural in nature,
        material should be presented from a scientific and secular perspective.
        Pseudoscience, supernatural, or paranormal topics can include any topics that are
        not agreed upon by a preponderance of experts, explanations for phenomena that are
        not well supported by research, or any topics that have their basis in folklore or
        superstition, but are not supported by the scientific community. Example topics
        can include - but are not limited to - essential oil treatments, crystal healing,
        the law of attraction, ghosts, astrology, fortune-telling, or extraterrestrial
        beings. Topics in these categories generally have a basis in history, culture, or
        speculation. As such, they should not be presented as fact, but rather explored
        from a cultural or historical perspective. Descriptions should make clear that the
        approach is based on mainstream science, culture, or history, rather than
        promoting these topics as scientific truth or as part of a supernatural worldview.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Marginalized Groups</h3>
      <p>
        Marginalized groups of people include groups who have historically been overlooked
        or who have faced discrimination based on factors including, but not limited to,
        sex, gender, age, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or gender
        identity. Tagpros believes that classes based on these groups and topics deserve
        equal treatment and, occasionally, special consideration. In order to ensure that
        Tagpros is not spreading false narratives nor reinforcing discrimination and
        prejudice, Tagpros has higher expectations and scrutiny for evaluating these
        classes and the teachers who lead them. We would expect to see expertise in areas
        like education, community involvement, life experience, additional training or
        other things that might show expertise based on the marginalized group you are
        teaching about. Expectations for these classes:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Teachers have a degree connected to the topic they are teaching or additional
          training/education related to the topic.
        </li>
        <li>
          The sources used in class need to come from widely respected
          scholars/professionals in the field.{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
          The Class Experience section of the class’s description will need to contain an
          explanation of any resources that deal with racism and discrimination and
          include how those will be handled.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Tagpros requires that content on Tagpros be objective. Teaching the history and
        experiences of these marginalized groups leads to content being more objective:
        objectivity gives a more complete picture than has been traditionally told or
        studied. To counter the traditional narrative, more focus may be given to these
        groups in some classes and there may be classes entirely devoted to these specific
        groups or their experiences. Other perspectives must still be acknowledged so that
        the full story of the issue in question is taught.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Role-Playing</h3>
      <p>
        Tagpros understands the value of role-playing in education. Allowing students to
        take various perspectives and make decisions or solve crises helps students
        understand the concepts and learn empathy for those involved. Role-playing can
        include events or situations that are hypothetical or historical and any activity
        from acting out a situation like a play to making decisions based on historical
        text or hypothetical situations. When creating class listings that include
        role-playing, there are certain things that Tagpros will look for and that the
        teacher will need to consider:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Be sure there is time before the lesson to pre-teach any important information
          and lay out the parameters for the role-playing. Consider how you will approach
          any students that do not follow those parameters.
        </li>
        <li>
          If students are role-playing various perspectives, they may only really learn
          the one they play. Consider how you can ensure they learn numerous different
          perspectives.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure that there is ample time set aside after the role-playing to discuss any
          situations that arose that may need extra discussion or clarification, come back
          to the larger context and purpose of the role play, and to tie up any loose
          ends.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Some topics are so sensitive that they fall outside of Tagpros policies if they
        are role-played. Each class listing that includes role-playing will be evaluated
        with higher scrutiny as follows:
      </p>
      <p>Role-playing scenarios NOT allowed:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Scenarios that have kids play oppressor/oppressed roles</li>
        <li>
          Examples: prison guard/prisoner, plantation owner/slave, S.S.
          guard/Concentration Camp internee.
        </li>
        <li>Any group being depicted as superior or inferior</li>
        <li>Role-playing violence</li>
        <li>Role-playing marginalized groups in any way that is not empowering </li>
        <li>Anything in bad taste or in violation of our Tagpros policies.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Role-play that will face higher scrutiny, but may be acceptable:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Not acting, but taking perspectives of various groups to understand a complex
          problem.
        </li>
        <li>
          Example 1: Solving global warming and students taking the role of industries
          that emit carbon, environmental groups, government officials, citizens from
          different viewpoints.{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
          Example 2: Students take the role of various cabinet members and advise the
          president regarding a historical decision: Should the US have used the atomic
          bomb? How do we get American hostages freed in the Iran Hostage Crisis?{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
          Kids simulate a process like an assembly line, passing a law, making financial
          decisions. mimic an artist’s craft, learning the Charleston, etc.{' '}
        </li>
        <li>
          Trials, hypothetical or historical, will be considered based on the content.{' '}
        </li>
      </ol>
