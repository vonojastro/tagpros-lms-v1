      <p>
        If you need to communicate with your students or their parents, here are the
        options we provide:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Live video chatting during live classes</li>
        <li>Private messaging using your teacher’s account</li>
        <li>Announcements in the Class tab</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We advise that all communications regarding the class be made in the options
        provided above to avoid any suspicious activities from other people. This will
        also allow us to investigate incidents more easily to be able to act accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Video Chatting During Live Classes</h3>
      <p>
        Most of your communication with your learners will be during your classes on
        Jitsi. It is important for you to encourage your students to ask relevant
        questions that come into mind so that any issue can be resolved as quickly as
        possible.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Private Messaging</h3>
      <p>
        You can message both the parents and students using the private messaging feature
        of your teacher’s account. You can choose to message the parents to check up on
        the status of the students, schedule any makeup sessions, answer questions that
        they ask, etc. You can also message the students themselves to get more direct
        communication with them to have a deeper understanding of their progress in the
        class.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that private messages should only be about topics that are relevant to
        the class you are handling. Violation of this rule will be subject to penalties
        and will be evaluated by our support team.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Classroom Posts</h3>
      <p>
        You can also access the classroom to post any announcements from your class. All
        posts from the classroom can be seen by the parents and learners and the parents
        will also receive email notifications to ensure that everyone will be reached.
