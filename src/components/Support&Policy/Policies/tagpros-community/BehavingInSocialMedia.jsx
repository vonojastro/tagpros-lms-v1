        Tagpros is an online platform that spans different social media outlets. Because
        of this, we want to make sure that we post content that adheres to our{' '}
        <a href='/policies/tagpros-community/community-code-of-conduct' target='_blank'>
          Community Standards
        </a>{' '}
        and welcomes everyone who can see it.

        As a teacher, you should understand that your profession does not end after class.
        This means that even outside of the classroom, you still have the responsibility
        to embody the values of a model teacher when interacting with members of Tagpros.
        Because of this, we have a teacher social media policy that gives you guidelines
        on what to observe in the social media space as a Tagpros teacher.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Always maintain respectful interactions with other people. Do not create
          unnecessary conflict.
        </li>
        <li>
          Always assume the best intention of others. Social media has the dangers of
          miscommunication due to its online nature. It is best to first understand others
          before responding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not share personal information regarding the parents or students in Tagpros.
        </li>
