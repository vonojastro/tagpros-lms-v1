      <h3>Teacher responsibility for safety</h3>
      <p>
        As a teacher, it is also your responsibility to make sure that the students are
        able to learn in a safe environment. This means doing your part in following our
        policies regarding the safety basics for teachers. Poor judgment on safety and
        privacy will be dealt with on a case-to-case basis and can result in{' '}

      <h3>Classroom Safety Basics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The teacher should be present during the live meetings at all times.
          <ul>
            <li>The teacher should always have their cameras turned on during class.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Always check every learner’s identity before the class. This means seeing them
          via video or audio at least once every class. Tell all learners and parents that
          they should inform you if connecting through video is not possible. You should
          ask to confirm their identity or presence by speaking with the teacher usually
          before the online class start.
        </li>
        <li>
          If class discussion includes potentially dangerous materials, instruct them on
          how to handle the materials properly.
        </li>
        <li>
          When teaching about sensitive topics, always make sure that your learners are
          well-equipped for the discussion. Learn more about our class criteria{' '}
