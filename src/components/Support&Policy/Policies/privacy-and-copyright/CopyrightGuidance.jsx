      <h3>Copyright protections</h3>
      <p>
        According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, copyright protection
        extends to books, music, paintings, sculpture, and films, to computer programs,
        databases, advertisements, maps, and technical drawings. The protection lasts
        until 50 years until the authorâ€™s death. However, copyrighted materials may still
        be used for criticism or commentary under the fair use principle, but is subject
        to further scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Materials not allowed in class</h3>
      <p>
        As a general rule, using materials that are copyrighted by an author is not
        allowed unless utilized under the fair use principle. In your class listings, make
        sure that you have permission on the images that you will be using or that the
        materials do not have copyright protection. The same is true for materials that
        will be used during the class except if the material will be used for criticism or
        commentary.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Response to Copyrighted materials</h3>
      <p>
        If your class has been reported to have contained materials that violate
        intellectual property rights, then we will immediately remove the mentioned
        material from your class. This could mean that the class could be suspended or
        taken down until the issue has been resolved. This will happen when we receive a
        DMCA notification regarding the illegal use of material, trademark logo, or
        wordmark.{' '}
