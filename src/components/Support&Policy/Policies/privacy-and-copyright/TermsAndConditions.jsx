      <p>
        If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        All provisions of Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall
        survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty
        disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

      <h3>20. Governing Law</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the
        Philippines, which governing law applies to an agreement without regard to its
        conflict of law provisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be
        considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be
        invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will
        remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding
        our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had
        between us regarding Service.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>21. Changes To Service</h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service or material
        we provide via Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be
        liable if for any reason all or any part of Service is unavailable at any time or
        for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of
        Service, or the entire Service, to users, including registered users.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsop;</p>
      <h3>22. Amendments To Terms</h3>
      <p>
        We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. It is
        your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised Terms means
        that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page
        frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.
      </p>
      <p>
        By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective,
        you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms,
        you are no longer authorized to use Service.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>23. Waiver And Severability</h3>
      <p>
        No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be deemed a
        further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other
        term or condition, and any failure of Company to assert a right or provision under
        Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent
        jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such
        provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the
        remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and effect.
      </p>
