        “we” “us” or “our''). We provide online video hosting, sharing and related
        services through our owned-and-operated websites, including Tagpros.com and
        Tagpros.Org, and all Tagpros Social Media Sites (Facebook, Tiktok, Instagram,
        Linkedin, and Youtube), our branded applications for mobile and connected devices,
        and our embeddable video players (collectively, the “services'').
      </p>
      <b>Acceptance and Changes</b>
      <p>
        By registering for, downloading, or using our services, you accept this Privacy
        Policy, which is part of our Terms of Service and may modify this Privacy Policy
        from time to time. We will post any modified version of our Privacy Policy at our
        website Tagpros. us If we change the Privacy Policy in a way that materially
        lessens our commitments to you, we will provide notice to registered users by
        email or other methods.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>2. Children's Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals who are under
        the minimum required ages specified herein. You must be at least 16 years old or
        the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is greater, to use our
        services. Individuals under the applicable age may use our services only through a
        parent or legal guardian's account and with their involvement. If you are a parent
        or legal guardian who believes your child has provided personal information to
        Tagpros without your consent, you may ask us to delete such information by
        contacting us at{' '}

      <h3>3. Data We Collect About You</h3>
      <p>
        We collect information about you when you use our services. In addition, third
        parties may collect information about you when you use our services. Collected
        information may include or reflect personal information that could identify you,
        as well as non-personal information. We refer to your information as "your data"
        for short.
      </p>
      <b>Account Information</b>
      <p>To create an account, you must provide a valid email address and password.</p>
      <b>Financial Information</b>
      <p>
        For those who will purchase service(s) or course(s), you may need to provide a
        valid Paypal payment email. Your payment information will be collected and
        processed. We do not directly collect or store credit or debit card numbers
        ourselves in the ordinary course of processing transactions. If we allow purchase
        through a third-party platform (i.e. in-app purchase), the payment method stored
        with the third-party platform will be charged.
      </p>
      <b>Content of Users Submitted </b>
      <p>
        You may upload, create, and submit your videos through our Tagpros.us on a
        work-for-hire agreement negotiated by the Tagpros Education Team. For details of
        the provision of our work-for-hire agreement, please refer to Section 7 below.
        Based on this, your videos may be viewed and otherwise accessed by others, and
        associated metadata (e.g., titles, closed captions, descriptions, tags, etc.) may
        be viewable by others as all copyrights and its derivatives are transferred to
        Tagpros perpetually.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        If you submit images or videos to us, we may make electronic art works and
        alterations, for the sole purpose of creating a commercially viable video product
        for education. In doing so, we may provide various types of graphics integrated in
        the content for the purpose of creating a video for sale, subscription, or
        reproduction.{' '}
      </p>
      <b>Other Information You May Submit</b>
      <p>
        You may submit data to us for limited purposes such as requesting customer
        support; participating in a study or survey; entering Tagpros’s sponsored
        contests; applying for a job; or signing up to receive communications from us or
        another user.
      </p>
      <b>Automatically-Collected Information</b>
      <p>
        We automatically collect certain types of data when you use our services,
        regardless of whether you have an account. This data includes your IP address,
        technical information about your device (e.g., browser type, operating system,
        basic device information), the web page you visited or search query you entered
        before reaching us, and your activities. We may track your activities using
        cookies and similar technologies. By using our services, you agree to our use of
        these methods as set forth in our Cookie Policy.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>4. How We Use Your Data</h3>
      <p>We may use your data for the following purposes:</p>
      <div className='indent'>
        <p>
          Identification and authentication: We use your data to verify you when you
          access your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Operating our services: We use your data to provide our services, process and
          fulfill orders, provide customer support, and to otherwise comply with our
          contractual obligations to you. We (and/or our third-party vendors) use your
          financial information to process purchases made by you and to pay you amounts
          you have earned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Communicating with you: We use your data when we communicate with you (e.g.,
          when we respond to a customer support or other inquiry). Improving our services:
          We use your data to understand how our services are being used and how we can
          improve them. In general, we analyze aggregated data, rather than specific user
          data. We may, however, need to analyze a specific case to address a specific
          problem (e.g., a bug that affects only a few accounts).
        </p>
        <p>
          Customizing your experience: We use your data to personalize the service to you.
          This may include remembering your preferences for language or volume or
          displaying videos that you might enjoy, based upon your viewing choices.
          Marketing and advertising: We use your data to show you ads on our Tagpros.us
          site or third-party sites, and to measure the effectiveness of those ads.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exercising our rights: Where reasonably necessary, we use your data to exercise
          our legal rights and prevent abuse of our service. For example, we may use your
          data to detect and prevent fraud, spam, or content that violates our Terms of
          Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Legal compliance: We use your data where we are legally required to do so. For
          example, we may need to gather your data to respond to a subpoena or court
          order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Protecting your information: Where appropriate, we may anonymize, backup, and
          delete certain data.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        We may use algorithms and other automated means to implement any of the above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever we process your data for one of these purposes, we have determined that
        one or more of the following lawful bases apply:
      </p>
      <div className='indent'>
        <p>Performance of a contract;</p>
        <p>Legitimate commercial interest;</p>
        <p>Compliance with a legal obligation; or Consent</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        If you require further information about the balancing test that Tagpros has
        undertaken to justify its reliance on legitimate interest as a lawful basis of
        processing, see last paragraph below for information on how to contact us.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>5. With Whom We Share Your Data</h3>
      <p>We share your videos data with third parties as follows:</p>
      <div className='indent'>
        <p>
          We may share your videos or data with third parties, such as Schools and School
          Districts.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share your data with third-party vendors that help us operate our
          services, process orders, and comply with your instructions and our contractual
          obligations. This includes payment processors, content delivery networks (CDNs),
          cloud-based hosting services, monitoring services, email service providers,
          quality assurance and testing vendors, fraud and abuse prevention vendors,
          customer relations management (CRM) vendors, and shipment vendors.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share your data with analytics providers which help us understand how
          customers are using our services. We may also share identifying analytics
          information with the hosts of webinars you attend, or users of your
          organization-administered account (see below for more details).
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share your data with our auditors and advisors for planning, financial
          reporting, accounting, auditing, tax filings, and legal practitioners.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share your data with our affiliates to the extent necessary to provide
          you with the services ordered.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share your data where we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with a
          legal obligation or in connection with a corporate transaction. We may publicly
          disclose non-personal aggregated or anonymized information such as our number of
          visitors and registered users.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        We use reasonable efforts to vet vendors for their privacy and data security
        practices. We require that such vendors agree to protect the data we share.
      </p>
      <b>Organization-Administered Accounts</b>
      <p>
        You may create a Tagpros account using an email address provided or assigned to
        you by an organization (such as your work email address). If the organization
        establishes a direct relationship with us, they may, with prior notice, convert
        your personal account to become part of the organization's account.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>This means the organization may:</p>
      <div className='indent'>
        <p>Access information about your account activity;</p>
        <p>
          Take control of the account, including any content whether uploaded before or
          after the date that the organization converts your account to the organization's
          account; and/or
        </p>
        <p>Delete your account.</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        If you sign up for a Tagpros account using an email address issued to you by an
        organization, Tagpros may share your personal information (e.g., name, email
        address) with such organization. If you do not want an organization to access or
        otherwise control an account, use a personal email address and do not use an
        organizational email address when creating an account.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>6. Legal and Safety-Related Disclosures</h3>
      <p>
        We may disclose your data in response to official requests (e.g., court orders,
        subpoenas, search warrants, national security requests, etc.) ("requests") that we
        receive from government authorities or parties to legal proceedings.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        We handle U.S. requests in accordance with U.S. law. Similarly, we handle
        Philippine Requests in accordance with Philippine Law. If the request originates
        from a foreign jurisdiction, we will typically disclose information where we in
        good faith believe that disclosure is permitted by both U.S. law and local law. In
        all cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us, in
        our sole discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may disclose user data where we reasonably believe that someone's life is at
        risk. For example, if we become aware of a person threatening to commit suicide,
        we may share that person's data with appropriate entities that may have the
        ability to help.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may disclose user data to report suspected crimes. We report content suspected
        of exploiting minors to the Philippine National Police along with the data
        identifying the uploading user.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may disclose user data in situations involving legal claims against us or one
        of our users. If you submit an{' '}
        <a
          href='http://www.federislaw.com.ph/faqs-resources/copyright/'
          target='_blank'

        >
          infringement complaint, we will apply this under Philippine Copyright Law
        </a>{' '}
        or other takedown notice, we may share that notice with the affected user. If you
        challenge such a notice, we may share your response with the complainant.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may share your data with potential transaction partners, advisors, and others
        in the event our company is, in whole or part, acquired by a third party. In such
        cases, we will use reasonable efforts to require the acquiring entity to comply
        with the{' '}

        .
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>7. Work For Hire - Videos/Data</h3>
      <p>
        All videos in our Self-Paced Subscription Platform, are under a “work-for-hire
        services” agreement, and shall be owned fully by Tagpros (“Owner”), including the
        full term of copyright, derivatives, and any extensions or renewals, all copyright
        in and to the Contribution, and all rights therein, including but not limited to
        the right to publish, republish, transmit, sell, distribute and otherwise use the
        Contribution in whole or in part in electronic and video editions, and in
        derivative works throughout the world, in all languages and in all media of
        expression now known or later developed, and to license or permit others to do so.
        “Contribution” means the videos submitted by a teacher for publication on all our
        websites and its social media sites (including any embedded rich media) and all
        subsequent versions.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>8. Communications from Us</h3>
      <b>Emails</b>
      <p>
        If you create an account, you may receive commercial emails from us. This includes
        electronic offers. You may always opt out by submitting a written email request to{' '}
        <a href='mailto:customercare@tagpros.org' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>
          customercare@tagpros.org
        </a>
        . Please note that any opt-out request may take several days to process and you
        will continue to receive transactional emails from us (e.g., emails confirming
        transactions and/or providing information about your account).
      </p>
      <b>Mobile Device Communications</b>
      <p>
        We may, with your consent, send push notifications in our apps. You may disable
        these by declining them or changing the app's settings. To the extent provided, we
        may, with your consent, send SMS messages to your mobile telephone for
        authentication and security purposes. You may opt out of receiving such messages
        at any time.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>9. Protecting Your Information</h3>
      <p>
        We use physical, technical, and organizational security measures to safeguard your
        data from unauthorized or accidental disclosure. Despite these efforts, no
        information system can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute
        security of your information. Users also have a role to play in keeping their data
        safe. We encourage you to use a unique and hard-to-guess password for your account
        and to not share it with others. You should only grant access rights to people who
        you know and trust, and, even then, you should be careful in granting all access
        rights. You should monitor your account regularly. If you believe that someone has
        gained access to your account without your permission, please contact us
        immediately so that we can investigate.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>10. Your Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>
        You may receive other people's data using our service. If you receive information
        from other users, you must process that information in compliance with your
        published privacy policy and all applicable laws, including those concerning
        privacy, data security, and online marketing.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>11. Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>
        We may provide links to online services that we do not own or operate. These
        services fall outside of this Privacy Policy and we have no control over the data
        they collect, say Job Ads created by School District(s). For example, if you click
        on a job advertisement, you may be taken to the school district’s dashboards,
        where they can collect your information.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        You may use our service through third-party sites and to send you offers. For
        example, you may watch a video from Youtube or use one of our apps on a
        third-party platform. This Privacy Policy covers our apps and video players, but
        does not cover any third-party site or any third-party video player.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>12. International Data Transfers and Certain User Rights</h3>
      <b>Location of Data</b>
      <p>
        Tagpros is based in the Philippines and the United States. We provide services
        globally using computer systems, servers, and databases located in the U.S. and
        other countries. When you use our services from outside of the jurisdiction
        mentioned above, your information may be transferred to and processed in the U.S..
        Please note that U.S. data and privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those
        in your country.{' '}
