We (and/or our third-party vendors) use your\n          financial information to process purchases made by you and to pay you amounts\n          you have earned.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Communicating with you: We use your data when we communicate with you (e.g.,\n          when we respond to a customer support or other inquiry). Improving our services:\n          We use your data to understand how our services are being used and how we can\n          improve them. In general, we analyze aggregated data, rather than specific user\n          data. We may, however, need to analyze a specific case to address a specific\n          problem (e.g., a bug that affects only a few accounts).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Customizing your experience: We use your data to personalize the service to you.\n          This may include remembering your preferences for language or volume or\n          displaying videos that you might enjoy, based upon your viewing choices.\n          Marketing and advertising: We use your data to show you ads on our Tagpros.us\n          site or third-party sites, and to measure the effectiveness of those ads.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Exercising our rights: Where reasonably necessary, we use your data to exercise\n          our legal rights and prevent abuse of our service. For example, we may use your\n          data to detect and prevent fraud, spam, or content that violates our Terms of\n          Service.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Legal compliance: We use your data where we are legally required to do so. For\n          example, we may need to gather your data to respond to a subpoena or court\n          order.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Protecting your information: Where appropriate, we may anonymize, backup, and\n          delete certain data.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        We may use algorithms and other automated means to implement any of the above.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Whenever we process your data for one of these purposes, we have determined that\n        one or more of the following lawful bases apply:\n      </p>\n      <div className='indent'>\n        <p>Performance of a contract;</p>\n        <p>Legitimate commercial interest;</p>\n        <p>Compliance with a legal obligation; or Consent</p>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        If you require further information about the balancing test that Tagpros has\n        undertaken to justify its reliance on legitimate interest as a lawful basis of\n        processing, see last paragraph below for information on how to contact us.\n      </p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <h3>5.

This includes payment processors, content delivery networks (CDNs),\n          cloud-based hosting services, monitoring services, email service providers,\n          quality assurance and testing vendors, fraud and abuse prevention vendors,\n          customer relations management (CRM) vendors, and shipment vendors.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We may share your data with analytics providers which help us understand how\n          customers are using our services.

If you do not want an organization to access or\n        otherwise control an account, use a personal email address and do not use an\n        organizational email address when creating an account.{' '}\n      </p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <h3>6. Legal and Safety-Related Disclosures</h3>\n      <p>\n        We may disclose your data in response to official requests (e.g., court orders,\n        subpoenas, search warrants, national security requests, etc.) (\"requests\") that we\n        receive from government authorities or parties to legal proceedings.{' '}\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We handle U.S. requests in accordance with U.S. law. Similarly, we handle\n        Philippine Requests in accordance with Philippine Law. If the request originates\n        from a foreign jurisdiction, we will typically disclose information where we in\n        good faith believe that disclosure is permitted by both U.S. law and local law. In\n        all cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us, in\n        our sole discretion.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We may disclose user data where we reasonably believe that someone's life is at\n        risk. For example, if we become aware of a person threatening to commit suicide,\n        we may share that person's data with appropriate entities that may have the\n        ability to help.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We may disclose user data to report suspected crimes.

Protecting Your Information</h3>\n      <p>\n        We use physical, technical, and organizational security measures to safeguard your\n        data from unauthorized or accidental disclosure. Despite these efforts, no\n        information system can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute\n        security of your information. Users also have a role to play in keeping their data\n        safe. We encourage you to use a unique and hard-to-guess password for your account\n        and to not share it with others. You should only grant access rights to people who\n        you know and trust, and, even then, you should be careful in granting all access\n        rights. You should monitor your account regularly. If you believe that someone has\n        gained access to your account without your permission, please contact us\n        immediately so that we can investigate.\n      </p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <h3>10. Your Responsibilities</h3>\n      <p>\n        You may receive other people's data using our service. If you receive information\n        from other users, you must process that information in compliance with your\n        published privacy policy and all applicable laws, including those concerning\n        privacy, data security, and online marketing.\n      </p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <h3>11. Third-Party Services</h3>\n      <p>\n        We may provide links to online services that we do not own or operate. These\n        services fall outside of this Privacy Policy and we have no control over the data\n        they collect, say Job Ads created by School District(s). For example, if you click\n        on a job advertisement, you may be taken to the school district’s dashboards,\n        where they can collect your information.{' '}\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        You may use our service through third-party sites and to send you offers. For\n        example, you may watch a video from Youtube or use one of our apps on a\n        third-party platform. This Privacy Policy covers our apps and video players, but\n        does not cover any third-party site or any third-party video player.\n      </p>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <h3>12. International Data Transfers and Certain User Rights</h3>\n      <b>Location of Data</b>\n      <p>\n        Tagpros is based in the Philippines and the United States.
