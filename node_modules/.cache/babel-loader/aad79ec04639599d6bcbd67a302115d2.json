This policy is in accordance with the U.S. Children’s\nOnline Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), and outlines our practices in the United States\n\n\nregarding Children’s personal information. For more information about COPPA and\ngeneral tips about protecting Children’s online privacy, please visit OnGuard Online.\n\nCollection: Tagpros collects information about students directly from Parents, who\nprovide us with the Child’s first name, age, type of schooling, local time zone, and\nadditional notes for the Teacher. In addition, Children may share information about\nthemselves during Classes. The Tagpros class sessions may take place over online\nvideos in which video images and audio of the Children are recorded. No information is\ncollected directly from Children until they are in the course session. Children cannot\npost personal data publicly on the Tagpros Services.\n\nUse and Disclosure: Tagpros shares the name, age, local time zone, and any notes\nParents have provided about their Child to the Class Teacher, in order to allow the\nTeacher to provide Classes. This information shall also be treated as part of the Parent’s\n“Personal Data” and may be shared as described in the Disclosure section above for\nbusiness transfers; to vendors and service providers; and to comply with legal\nrequirements. Children may also share information about themselves with the Teacher\nand the rest of their class during the Class session voluntarily. While Tagpros expects\nTeachers and all other Users to abide by our standards of conduct, please note that we\ncannot control or monitor what personal information your Child shares with Teachers or\nother classmates, nor what those third parties ultimately do with that information, and\nwe disclaim all responsibility in that regard.\n\nClass Video Recordings: As described above, Tagpros records video of students and\nteachers during Tagpros classes (“Class Recordings' '). The Class Recordings are made\navailable by Tagpros to the Teacher of the Class and may be shared by the Teacher for\nthe entire class (and their Parents) to view (the “Permitted Recipients''). Please note\nthat in some cases, Classes are taught by a “Teacher” undergoing observations from\nschool districts, groups, or a team of instructors (“Teacher Organization ''). In such\ncases, Class Recordings may be accessed by these groups or entities, and access\nwould not necessarily be limited to a single individual instructor. Tagpros may also use\nClass Recordings to provide feedback to Teachers, for customer support, for\ncompliance purposes, and for teaching and career development of teachers\ninternationally and locally. Tagpros will obtain additional parental consent before we use\nany Class Recordings for promotional or other purposes. We utilize reasonable means\nto (i) limit the ability of Teachers to create copies of the Class Recordings or to share the\nClass Recordings with anyone aside from Permitted Recipients, and also (ii) limit the\nability of Permitted Recipients to download or re-share the Class Recordings. While we\nexpect Teachers and Permitted Recipients to abide by our standards of conduct, please\n\n\nnote that we cannot control or monitor what such third parties ultimately do with Class\nRecordings, and disclaim all responsibility in that regard.\n\nParental Consent: Tagpros obtains verifiable parental consent before collecting\nPersonal Data from your Child. Tagpros requires that you provide your credit card\ninformation in order to register your Child for and pay for a Tagpros Class.

Please keep in mind that a request to delete records may\nlead to a termination of an account, membership, or other service. You may update your\nChild’s information by logging onto your account. You can contact Tagpros to request\naccess to, change, or delete your Child’s personal information by sending an email to us\nat customercare@tagpros.us. A valid request to delete personal information will be\naccommodated within a reasonable time. In addition to the foregoing, we will exercise\ncommercially reasonable efforts to delete personal information belonging to Children\nwhen it is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was collected.\n\n## Links to Other Websites\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies only to the Tagpros Services.

For more information about COPPA and\ngeneral tips about protecting Children’s online privacy, please visit OnGuard Online.\n\nCollection: Tagpros collects information about students directly from Parents, who\nprovide us with the Child’s first name, age, type of schooling, local time zone, and\nadditional notes for the Teacher. In addition, Children may share information about\nthemselves during Classes. The Tagpros class sessions may take place over online\nvideos in which video images and audio of the Children are recorded. No information is\ncollected directly from Children until they are in the course session. Children cannot\npost personal data publicly on the Tagpros Services.\n\nUse and Disclosure: Tagpros shares the name, age, local time zone, and any notes\nParents have provided about their Child to the Class Teacher, in order to allow the\nTeacher to provide Classes. This information shall also be treated as part of the Parent’s\n“Personal Data” and may be shared as described in the Disclosure section above for\nbusiness transfers; to vendors and service providers; and to comply with legal\nrequirements. Children may also share information about themselves with the Teacher\nand the rest of their class during the Class session voluntarily. While Tagpros expects\nTeachers and all other Users to abide by our standards of conduct, please note that we\ncannot control or monitor what personal information your Child shares with Teachers or\nother classmates, nor what those third parties ultimately do with that information, and\nwe disclaim all responsibility in that regard.\n\nClass Video Recordings: As described above, Tagpros records video of students and\nteachers during Tagpros classes (“Class Recordings' '). The Class Recordings are made\navailable by Tagpros to the Teacher of the Class and may be shared by the Teacher for\nthe entire class (and their Parents) to view (the “Permitted Recipients''). Please note\nthat in some cases, Classes are taught by a “Teacher” undergoing observations from\nschool districts, groups, or a team of instructors (“Teacher Organization ''). In such\ncases, Class Recordings may be accessed by these groups or entities, and access\nwould not necessarily be limited to a single individual instructor. Tagpros may also use\nClass Recordings to provide feedback to Teachers, for customer support, for\ncompliance purposes, and for teaching and career development of teachers\ninternationally and locally. Tagpros will obtain additional parental consent before we use\nany Class Recordings for promotional or other purposes. We utilize reasonable means\nto (i) limit the ability of Teachers to create copies of the Class Recordings or to share the\nClass Recordings with anyone aside from Permitted Recipients, and also (ii) limit the\nability of Permitted Recipients to download or re-share the Class Recordings. While we\nexpect Teachers and Permitted Recipients to abide by our standards of conduct, please\n\n\nnote that we cannot control or monitor what such third parties ultimately do with Class\nRecordings, and disclaim all responsibility in that regard.\n\nParental Consent: Tagpros obtains verifiable parental consent before collecting\nPersonal Data from your Child.

Please keep in mind that a request to delete records may\nlead to a termination of an account, membership, or other service. You may update your\nChild’s information by logging onto your account. You can contact Tagpros to request\naccess to, change, or delete your Child’s personal information by sending an email to us\nat customercare@tagpros.us. A valid request to delete personal information will be\naccommodated within a reasonable time. In addition to the foregoing, we will exercise\ncommercially reasonable efforts to delete personal information belonging to Children\nwhen it is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was collected.\n\n## Links to Other Websites\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies only to the Tagpros Services. The Services may contain links\nto other websites not operated or controlled by us (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies\nand procedures we describe here do not apply to the Third Party Sites.
