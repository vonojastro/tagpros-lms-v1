As the provider of an online marketplace, Tagpros does not\n          own, create, sell, resell, control, or manage any Classes. Tagpros's responsibilities are limited to: (i)\n          providing the Site as an online marketplace and platform to facilitate the sale, purchase, and conduct of\n          Classes, and (ii) serving as the limited agent of each Teacher for the purpose of accepting payments from a\n          Parent on behalf of the Teacher. There are risks that you assume when dealing with other Users (including\n          those who may be acting under false pretenses). While Tagpros strives to provide a safe and welcoming\n          environment (how do we safeguard) for its Users, you agree that all of these risks are ultimately borne by\n          you, and not Tagpros. Tagpros does not control the behavior of Users or the quality of the Classes. As a\n          result, Tagpros cannot guarantee the authenticity, quality, safety, legality, or appropriateness of the\n          Classes.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Your Registration Obligations:</strong>&nbsp;You will be required to register with Tagpros in order to\n          access and use certain features of the Service.

You must be of legal age to form a\n          binding contract to register for the Service (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18). If you are not yet of\n          legal age to form a binding contract, then you must get your Parent to read these Terms of Service and agree\n          to them for you before you use the Service. If you are a Parent and you provide your consent to your child's\n          use of the Service, then you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service with respect to your child&rsquo;s\n          use of the Service.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Member Account, Password and Security:</strong>&nbsp;You are responsible for maintaining the\n          confidentiality of your password and account, if any, and are fully responsible for any and all activities\n          that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Tagpros of any unauthorized use\n          of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at\n          the end of each session when accessing the Service.

You agree that Tagpros\n          will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the\n          Service.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>General Practices Regarding Use and Storage:</strong>&nbsp;You acknowledge that Tagpros may establish\n          general practices and limits concerning use of the Service, including without limitation the maximum period of\n          time that data or other content will be retained by the Service and the maximum storage space that will be\n          allotted on Tagpros&rsquo;s servers on your behalf. You agree that Tagpros has no responsibility or liability\n          for the deletion or failure to store any data or other content maintained or uploaded by the Service.

We value student and Teacher privacy,\n          and our use of Class Recordings is extremely limited. Specifically, Class Recordings are made available only\n          to the Teacher providing the Class in question, in order to allow them to (1) provide a viewable copy to\n          students who missed the Class, or who wish to review the Class, for their personal educational purposes; and\n          (2) review the Class Recording personally in order to improve their Classes. Please note that in some cases,\n          Classes are taught by a Teacher that is actually an organization, group, or team of instructors. In such\n          cases, Class Recordings may be accessed by the organization, and access would not necessarily be limited to a\n          single individual instructor. In addition, Tagpros may use Class Recordings to provide feedback to Teachers,\n          to improve our Services, for customer support, and for compliance purposes. Tagpros retains Class Recordings\n          for six months after the date of the applicable Class, subject to our Privacy Policy, after which they are\n          deleted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tagpros will also delete Class Recordings earlier than six months\n          under the following circumstances: (a) upon the request of a Parent for the deletion of their child&rsquo;s\n          personally identifiable information, or (b) upon the reasonable determination of Tagpros that a Class\n          Recording should be removed to protect the privacy of certain Users or because of violations of these Terms of\n          Service. We will not use Class Recordings containing images of you (or your children) for promotional or any\n          other purposes without your express written consent.&nbsp;\n          <strong>\n            By using the services, you consent to you and/or your child appearing in Class Recordings for the limited\n            purposes set forth above.\n          </strong>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Certain Teacher Obligations</strong>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          As a Teacher, you must provide Tagpros with any information requested in order for Tagpros to list your\n          Classes through its Services including but not limited to a description of the Classes and the price for the\n          Classes. Tagpros has sole discretion as to which Classes we list on the marketplace and we reserve the right\n          to reject any Classes or remove Classes from the marketplace for any reason. Additionally, Tagpros has\n          discretion to edit Class descriptions as needed to conform them to our marketplace standards. Tagpros has sole\n          discretion as to which Teachers are accepted into the marketplace and we reserve the right to reject any\n          potential Teacher and remove or suspend any Teacher from the marketplace for any reason. Tagpros may, but is\n          not required to, conduct background checks on and interviews of Teachers in its discretion and solely for its\n          own benefit. As a Teacher, you agree to provide written and/or electronic consent to such background checks\n          and to participate truthfully in such interviews.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          When you join the Tagpros community, you agree to follow our policies, including our community standards.\n          Those expectations include thoughtful and professional communications with our community (colleagues, parents,\n          children), modeling appropriate behavior for our learners, and acting professionally. In addition, you agree\n          to use social media, blogs, and other online forums, in an appropriate manner. Inappropriate behavior in any\n          Tagpros-affiliated online forum includes, but is not limited to: behavior intended to provoke, bully, demean,\n          or cause harm to others, or to create conflict; or any other posts or content that Tagpros, in its discretion,\n          believes to be unconducive to a respectful and welcoming community for all. Inappropriate behavior in any\n          online forum includes, but is not limited to: posting online or speaking to the media on Tagpros&rsquo;s\n          behalf without prior written authorization from Tagpros; posts that Tagpros, in its discretion, finds to be\n          offensive or inappropriate based on race, sex, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression,\n          national origin, disability or medical condition, veteran status, or any other legally protected\n          characteristic; derogatory, disparaging, or disrespectful comments about learners, teachers, parents, or\n          Tagpros staff, even if the target is not identified by name; sharing any private material, communication, or\n          information regarding parents of learners, including but not limited to students&rsquo; or parents&rsquo;\n          names, photos, conversations, emails, student academic or performance information, screenshots of student\n          work, or any other personal identifying information; posts that may be harmful to Tagpros&rsquo;s ongoing\n          business operations; sharing content that contains or promotes hate speech, threats of violence, or the\n          endangerment of children; and any other violation of Tagpros&rsquo;s community standards.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Each Teacher is solely responsible for obtaining all licenses and other permissions required to offer or\n          provide any Classes, and Tagpros assumes no responsibility for a Teacher's failure to obtain such licenses or\n          permissions or otherwise comply with any applicable laws, rules or regulations.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          You understand and agree that Tagpros is not an insurer, agent or employer for you as a Teacher. If a Parent\n          purchases any of your Classes, any agreement you enter into with such Parent is between you and the Parent,\n          and Tagpros is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tagpros is authorized to serve as your\n          limited agent purely for the purpose of accepting payments from Parents on your behalf and transmitting such\n          payments to you (minus our Fees). You acknowledge and agree that, as a Teacher, you are responsible for your\n          own acts and omissions while using the Services. With the sole exception of students enrolled in the\n          applicable Class, and/or their Parents, you further agree that you will not share any Class Recordings made\n          available to you by Tagpros to any third parties. Allowing other Teachers within your organization to view the\n          Class Recordings, however, is permissible.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          To the extent that you are using the Services as a Teacher, you agree to abide by the terms of\n          our&nbsp;Teacher Guide.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Payment Terms</strong>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>General:</strong>&nbsp;Each Parent agrees to pay all applicable fees for Classes (&ldquo;Enrollment\n          Fees&rdquo;) as set forth on the Site. All Enrollment Fees are payable in the currency specified on the Site\n          at the time of purchase. You shall be responsible for all taxes associated with the Services other than U.S.\n          taxes based on Company&rsquo;s net income. Parent hereby authorizes Tagpros to bill Parent&rsquo;s payment\n          instrument upon confirmation of a purchase, and Parent further agrees to pay any charges so incurred. If\n          Parent disputes any charges you must let Tagpros know within sixty (60) days after the date that Tagpros\n          charges you.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Teacher Payment:</strong>&nbsp;Tagpros will transfer the Enrollment Fees to Teacher&rsquo;s Paypal\n          account for each sale of a Class (or set of Classes, as applicable) to a Parent within a reasonable period of\n          time, minus Tagpros&rsquo;s service fees (&ldquo;Tagpros Fee&rdquo;), according to the schedule and policies\n          detailed in our&nbsp;Teachers Guide. In order to transfer funds to Teacher&rsquo;s Paypal account, Teacher\n          shall sign up for a Paypal account. Tagpros has discretion to act on behalf of the Parent, and to not transfer\n          the Enrollment Fees to Teacher, if Parent reports that the Classes were not provided or adequately completed.\n          This may include but is not limited to circumstances where a Teacher did not arrive for a Class or a Class was\n          of insufficient quality. Tagpros will independently review such cases, seeking input from the Parent and/or\n          the Teacher, and may decide at its sole discretion to issue a refund to the Parent. All determinations of\n          Tagpros with respect to a refund shall be final and binding on the Parent and Teacher.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Limited Payment Collections Agent:</strong>&nbsp;Each Teacher appoints Tagpros as the Teacher&rsquo;s\n          limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the Enrollment Fees from Parent. Each\n          User agrees that payment of Enrollment Fees by a Parent to Tagpros, as that Teacher&rsquo;s limited payment\n          collection agent, shall be considered the same as a payment made directly by such Parent to the relevant\n          Teacher and the Teacher will provide the relevant Classes to the Parent, as outlined on the Site, as if the\n          Teacher had received payment directly. Tagpros, as limited payment collection agent for the Teacher, agrees to\n          facilitate the payment of any Enrollment Fees (less the Tagpros Fee) for Classes pursuant to these Terms of\n          Service unless otherwise agreed between Tagpros and the Teacher. In the event that Tagpros does not remit such\n          amounts, the Teacher will have recourse only against Tagpros.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Conditions of Use</strong>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>User Conduct:</strong>&nbsp;You are solely responsible for all code, video, images, information, data,\n          text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, messages or other materials (&ldquo;content&rdquo;) that\n          you upload, post, publish or display (hereinafter, &ldquo;upload&rdquo;) or email or otherwise use via the\n          Service.

Further, this Arbitration\n          Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies,\n          and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering\n          into this Terms of Service, you and Tagpros are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in\n          a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal\n          Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief:</strong>&nbsp;YOU AND\n          TAGPROS AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A\n          PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND\n          TAGPROS AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON&rsquo;S OR\n          PARTY&rsquo;S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS\n          PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF)\n          ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF\n          NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY&rsquo;S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution:</strong>&nbsp;Tagpros is always interested in resolving disputes\n          amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer&rsquo;s\n          satisfaction by emailing customer support at&nbsp;scouts@tagpros.us. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a\n          party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of\n          Dispute (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;). The Notice to Tagpros should be sent to Tagpros, Inc. Lot 6 B, Blk 4 Del Rey\n          St., Greenfields 3 Novaliches Q.C., <strong>Philippines</strong> (&ldquo;Notice Address&rdquo;). The Notice\n          must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.\n          If Tagpros and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you\n          or Tagpros may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer\n          made by Tagpros or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the\n          amount, if any, to which you or Tagprosl is entitled.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Arbitration Procedures:</strong>&nbsp;Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in\n          accordance with the American Arbitration Association&rsquo;s (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) rules and procedures,\n          including the AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the &ldquo;AAA\n          Rules&rdquo;), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its\n          website,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.adr.org/\">https://www.adr.org/</a>. Information about the AAA Rules and\n          fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA&rsquo;s consumer arbitration page,&nbsp;\n          <a href=\"https://www.adr.org/consumer\">https://www.adr.org/consumer</a>. If there is any inconsistency between\n          any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration\n          Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration\n          Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the\n          provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including,\n          but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration\n          Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other\n          judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court\n          can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are\n          enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Unless Tagpros and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient\n          location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.\n          If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for\n          $10,000 or less, Tagpros agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the\n          basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as\n          established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the\n          AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a\n          reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is\n          based.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Costs of Arbitration:</strong>&nbsp;Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees\n          (collectively, the &ldquo;Arbitration Fees&rdquo;) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise\n          provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request,\n          Tagpros will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to\n          demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or\n          if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of\n          the Arbitration Fees, Tagpros will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the\n          arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Tagpros\n          will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from\n          being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys&rsquo; fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Confidentiality:</strong>&nbsp;All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or\n          award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Severability:</strong>&nbsp;If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this\n          Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled &ldquo;Prohibition of Class and Representative\n          Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&rdquo; above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace\n          such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to\n          expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement\n          shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of\n          subsection (b) above titled &ldquo;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized\n          Relief&rdquo; are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and\n          void.
