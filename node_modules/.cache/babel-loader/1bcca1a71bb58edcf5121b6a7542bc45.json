Your contract continues with your use of social media, blogs, and other\n          online forums, which we encourage you to participate in. They can provide\n          terrific opportunities to share educational resources, market your classes,\n          network, and share private and personal information and views.

While parents are responsible for supervising their kids,\n          we expect that you teach your classes in a way that encourages physical safety,\n          mental wellbeing, and online privacy for all students.

For\n          example, you shouldn’t share a photo or video of you interacting with your\n          students on your social media page.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If you would like to share any completed student work, such as a student essay\n          or art project, you will need to first obtain parent permission.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Since classes are recorded, it is also important to protect learner privacy on\n          the screen. In cases where learners have revealed personal information or\n          otherwise breached their privacy on camera, you should turn off their camera so\n          that it is not captured by other learners. You can then send the learner a\n          private chat through Jitsi Meet to let them know what is in view of their camera\n          without disrupting the class further. For more information on how to do this,\n          please visit our videos on For Teachers.

If there is a minimum age requirement, do not encourage\n          learners to lie about their age.
